0,"Stella F.San Francisco, CA","Just came from there. Food is good. However; we Sat there, my daughter and my 88 year old mother to eat. Our food was put in styrofoam carriers, that were cracked.  Then, on their TV they had playing, 21 Jump street. Every other word was F...., G. D..., Etc.  I really don't want to hear that or explicit scenes while I'm eating out.",3
1,"Sarah S.Winters, CA","The food here is actually great...when you get your order. Twice in the last 3 months I've received the wrong order or nothing other than rice. I spent over $30 on food and left around a $10 tip because times are hard and they're working hard... and I thought they were customer oriented, but boy was I wrong. I called and got hung up on multiple times, just to see if I could pick up the food I ordered. After making over 40 call attempts... I finally got a ""sorry we're closed,"" and I simply said ""I already ordered and didn't get my food"" with her response of ""oh sorry, we're closed. No more,"" and again hung up on.",1
2,"Mary D.CA, CA","Walked in and there was no greeting and when my dad ordered there was no explanation of any kind of specials. My dad ordered the ribs, which to their credit were hot and tasty. However, the clamshell was PACKED with rice, and the salad was old, wilted, and tasteless. Table still had some rice on it and the restaurant itself was not very clean. Fountain beverage was flat. For $25.00 you would expect much better food and service, we will not be returning.",1
3,"Victoria G.Elite 2023Citrus Heights, CA","Didn't find this place to be anything special. I'd never go out of my way to go back here. Staff wasn't very friendly, didn't even greet me when I walked in. I ordered food to go which took about ten minutes. When I started eating I questioned it the chicken was fully cooked. The rice was the best part. The menu said it came with steamed veggies but it looked like just cooked bean sprouts and not appealing at all. The sesame chicken was over cooked and lacked flavor. The teriyaki chicken was pretty good but nothing special. The quality and amount of food seemed over priced as well. Wanted to try it once at least and just thought it was food, didn't wow me at all.",2
4,"Sonya  W.Capitola, CA","Terrible, terrible, terrible customer service. Unsanitary. Awful food! Left my teen niece upset and confused when she went to pay for our order. An Easy problem that could have been diffused, but instead was escalated by an aggressive, and defensive young man. (Perhaps it's the owner or owners kid by his demeanor). Last time I will come here. And recommend you not come here!",1
5,"Royce N.Sacramento, CA",I don't recommend eating here. I walked in. I wasn't impressed.Very dirty. The restaurant needs a face lift. The restaurant has open containers on the counter with no lids of Teriyaki sauce. I wasn't going to eat it. . No telling what is flying into the containers. The woman of the restaurant was walking around behind the counter with long unbrushed bleached hair. I walked out of there. Very unappetizing. Pass this place up up. Go to the one in Notomas. Much better.,1
6,"Geoff P.Woodland, CA","Update 10-2020:I just had a frustrating experience, but I'm not lowering my rating of this place.  I still love them all the same even though the owner was a bit snappy with me just now.  I can attest to the attitude people are describing in the other reviews.  He told me 15min on the phone and I arrived after 20 and waited another 10.  I only really felt trapped after I had paid, so in the future I think I will wait to pay until the food is done.  That way if the wait truly ends up being longer than I can handle, I have the ability to walk away.  Meal was still delicious BTW!  Worth the wait for sure.",5
7,"Joseph L.Orange, CA","One extra star only because chicken and veggies were pretty good...went in one hour before closing. Was told only chicken available because ""getting ready to close."" Since I was on a work road trip, wanted to eat in. Told no because ""closing soon.""I never am one to go somewhere right at closing (family was in restaurant biz so I try to be respectful) but 50 minutes before closing is crazy to say can not eat there. It's fast food that takes 10 minutes to eat.The place is also really dirty. I suspect the same owners have the sushi place next door which looked good but also closed way early.  Several customers were turned away.",5
8,"Amanda M.West Sacramento, CA","Staff is super nice and helpful. Large portions and almost always gets your order correct.The location could be a little cleaner and the staff could not discuss person lives so loud as the kitchen is open to the dining area.I would recommend the spicy chicken, I always get the sauce on the side as they seem to put a lot and I prefer my white rice plain. Go check em out, you won't be disappointed.",2
9,"Cynthia H.Sacramento, CA",We have always enjoyed the quick meal that we get from the I Love Teriyaki establishments around the Sacramento area.  We decided to go to the Woodland store for the first time just because we were there.  The food was horrible.  There is nothing more to say.  Do your own comparison. This place shouldn't even hold the name it's such a disgrace,4
