1,"Jared S.Elite 2023Downtown, Sacramento, CA","I LOVE this place! Located in the heart of Midtown (Q and 19th to be exact), Pocha House has flavorful food and delicious drinks all in a fun, exciting environment. I got the Seoul whiskey drink and my fiancée got the ""peaches and cream."" Both were smooth, creative, and well thought cocktails. For food we split some fried rice, Korean fried chicken wings, and beef dumplings. DELICIOUS. So much flavor, and I loved the presentation! Service is spectacular. And the ambiance can't be beat. There's artwork and posters everywhere in this restaurant, with a bar and a DJ in the back (if you go later in the evening). Pocha House has one of the best vibes of any restaurant in Sacramento. I love restaurants that are an actual ""experience"" and not just ""food."" Pocha House is that. A++++++",5
2,"Jonah W.Elite 2023Brooklyn, NY","Was excited to learn about a new place in town that serves Tteokbokki. Came as a walk-in party of 2 on a Monday night and got seated right away although it was definitely busy. What hits you right away is the ~vibes~ of the place. The ambiance was definitely curated to evoke sort of an LA club vibe, with the dim lighting and neon signs making you feel like you're eating somewhere trendy. As a result, it seems like it attracts a younger crowd.Whether or not the vibes are your taste, the food itself delivers. I ordered the tteokbokki with ramen noodles and shared a kimchi pancake with my friend. The tteokbokki was very good and pretty big. It had plenty of rice cakes and fish cakes, and the sauce was flavorful. It was sweeter than other tteokbokki I've had, which was a little overwhelming at times but it also helped to balance out the spice. The kimchi pancake was not my favorite - too doughy and quickly became unappetizing after it cooled down.I'm very glad Pocha House came to Sac and I'm happy to have tried it, but I'm not sure I would return unless I'm specifically craving tteokbokki or unless they dialed down the clubby atmosphere. Would definitely recommend checking it out though!",4
3,"Caleb B.Natomas, Sacramento, CA","Looking for a bite to eat my family and I ran into Pocha House and decided to give it a shot.Located in midtown, parking is a bit inconvenient but not impossible to find along the street. On the outside the restaurant looks like a simple vintage brick house, but the inside has a completely different tone. The bright modern interior design is top notch, paired with a vibrant ambiance that elevates the dining experience. The only thing we noticed is there isn't a lot of proper seating, and some of the people in our party ended up sitting on stools.We were kindly greeted by a waitress who sat us down quickly. And checked on us several times throughout our meal.We ended up going with the Hot Cheetos Corn Cheese, Tteokbokki, Spicy Pork Bulgogi, and Fire Booty Booldak. All the plates had excellent taste and fair quantity. We definitely felt the Fire Booty Booldak needed more meat, as the tator tots completely dominated the dish. The Tteokbokki was one of the highlights, and we really enjoyed the rice cakes. Overall Pocha House had tasty food that we will likely return to in the future !",4
4,"Nareena V.Elite 2023San Jose, CA","I saw Pocha House on tiktok and I had to try it out! It's located in Midtown so parking can be a bit tough - luckily we found some street parking around the corner. The interior of the resturant is super cute! I also loved all the posters inside the bathroom. My friend and I came mainly for drinks. Definitely a bit pricey. I was also disappointed at the size of the large terra. Comparing to another Pocha in San Jose; the size was small for the price. But again, we came for the vibes.Food wise we order the soy garlic chicken and the pork belly salad. The chicken was crispy and flavorful. It came with a slaw, radish and pickled jalapeños. I loved the slaw sauce. The pork belly salad was a huge disappointment though - we love onions but it was just too strong of an onion flavor. There was also not that many pork belly slices.. I would definitely pass on this next time. The service here is also very good! Our server checked in with us often and was very nice. I would come again to try their other dishes. Hopefully a train passes by next time we're here!",4
5,"Trini L.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","This is the spot for drinks and appetizers! It is on the more pricier side though but it's definitely shareable! Really enjoyed the different dishes this restaurant has to offer, it's just like in a K-drama! We tried so many dishes and all of them were pretty delicious! I'd definitely come back here and take friends and family here. The only downside was we had to wait for extra chairs/seating since they were busy, kind of felt like they forgot about us.",4
6,"Paula C.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","Great ambiance, so relaxing. They have a bar and Korean food.We love this restaurant, the food was good and soju.This is our hangout spot to go too. YummmAlso fast service.Thank you",5
7,"Thuong N.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","I went to Pocha House with a few of my friends on a Friday night and was overall impressed by the food and service.9/10 Ambiance. This place gets very loud and lively at night. I thought it was the perfect atmosphere for a night out. I was very impressed by how fast the service was despite the crowd. We ordered our food/drinks and everything came out within 5-10 mins after the order was placed. ***I would definitely recommend going a bit earlier and adding your name to the waitlist as it can get quite busy. They will give you a text once your table is ready and you're free to hang out by the bar in the back while you wait.7.5/10 Food. Although a bit pricy, the food is quite good for a lounge/bar-type spot. I ordered a few things from the menu to try and my favorites were the Soy Garlic KFC Chicken and Bulgogi Fries. This is not a good place for a casual dinner or if you were looking to fuel up. This makes a much better occasion if you are looking to talk, drink, and have a few snacks while doing so.I definitely see myself coming back again in the future.",4
8,"Lisa S.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","Service: 5/5 Very nice on the phone, sweet and friendly in person, everyone had smiles and a great attitude. We thoroughly enjoyed every employee we encountered.Ambiance: 5/5Hip, live, dim, but not too much. The place was packed with people yet it didn't feel crowded because of how they had their tables spaced out. Nice open floor plan, with a nice full bar in the back. Great lighting.Food: 2.5/5Great options, but nothing memorable that'll bring us back. We ordered almost the whole menu. We love authentic Korean flavors from Korean grandmas and this was too modern for us. The kimchi was very salty. We were so sad because we wanted to like it so much!!! We love love love spicy, and nothing was spicy at all. Not even the fire booty buldak. Our 7 yr son, said it was sweet.My husband is Korean, so we frequent Mo Du Rang off of Folsom Blvd. in Sacramento. They have Korean Grandmas and mom's cooking in the back, they don't speak much English, but let me tell you, THEY CAN COOK SOME MEAN AUTHENTIC MEALS. We've been to almost every single Korean restaurant in the Sacramento region and around, and we always end up back at Mo Du Rang when the craving gets real.",3
9,"Athena M.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","Came here on a Saturday night around 7ish and it was about a 20min wait, they take down your number and send you a text when your table is ready. They might also give you the option to sit at the bar (if there is any room) if you don't want to wait for a table .. While waiting they informed us that we could go to the back of the restaurant to their other bar area & order some drinks while we wait. The second bar is not like the bar up in the front, they don't serve their specialty drinks instead you have to order drinks that you would get at any other bar.. We ordered their 4 shooter flight: peach soju with sour apple, lychee soju w/ blue curacao, pomegranate soju w/blood orange, strawberry soju w/ watermelon. To eat we ordered some fries and their Hot Cheetos corn cheese. It tasted great!We'll definitely have to be back to try out some more drinks and food!! I do love the vibe of this place!! Super chill and laid back.. They also play great music!",5
