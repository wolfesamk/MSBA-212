Ugw_47QOA16LnmLB-a54AaABAg,@keybladesrus,"Gurren Lagann is one of my favorite anime of all time. Recently, I watched all of Eva. The show, EoE, and the Rebuild movies. I was excited to do so because, on paper, Eva has so much that I should love in an anime. I wanted to see why it&#39;s so highly acclaimed, and thought I would love it. I HATED Eva. I lack the words and critical analysis skills to fully explain why, but I hated it so much. I only kept going because I needed to see why it was so loved. Surely something would happen at some point that would make it all click, and I would get it. That never happened, and by the end, I was just glad that it was over. <br><br>Throughout Eva, I kept thinking about Gurren Lagann and how both series kept touching on similar points, but I felt Gurren Lagann did so better and much more coherently. This video has helped me recognize the different perspectives both series approached the same points from, but my opinion on Eva hasn&#39;t changed at all. I&#39;m not sure why I feel that way. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Eva&#39;s pessimism as opposed to Gurren Lagann&#39;s optimism; the writer of two other favorite anime of mine, Gen Urobuchi, is known to be fatally allergic to happy endings and good vibes. I&#39;m a Kingdom Hearts fan, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the way Eva characters ramble at each other about philosophy and jargon instead of actually talking to each other like human beings. <br><br>I don&#39;t know, nor do I know if I have any point here.

UgzM4QCa3ykDq5AgzUp4AaABAg,@Kidneyjoe42,"I&#39;m not sure how to say this politely, but you more or less entirely misunderstood Evangelion. Eva isn&#39;t about everything being futile or doomed to fall or apart. It&#39;s about hope. Hope in spite of hardship, in spite of misunderstanding and pain. In both the TV ending and EoE, Shinji resolves to keep trying to live and find happiness as an individual human. He acknowledges the difficulties that entails and even concedes that he still hates himself. But he has hope that he can one day learn to love himself and connect with other people and so he&#39;s willing to keep trying. <br>TTGL isn&#39;t a refutation of Evangelion, they have almost exactly the same message. It&#39;s more of a spiritual successor. The one thing I&#39;d say you got right is the difference in the support the protagonist has. Evangelion is, for the most part, an individual struggle for each of the characters, not just Shinji. A great deal of their suffering is due to them being atomized and alone. And Shinji&#39;s big resolution in the end is largely about not continuing to let his self hatred and the fear that is born from it stand in the way of trying to connect with other people. Gurren Lagann basically starts from this point. Simon has the doubts and low opinion of himself that Shinji retains even through the end of Evangelion. But Simon is more willing to open himself up to and have faith in other people, which is what Shinji was at least trying to do in the end. Simon&#39;s growth isn&#39;t entirely due to external factors. While both Kamina and Nia make it their personal mission to build him up, Simon has to make the first move with both of them. This is especially true with Kamina. Simon only ended up with Kamina because he was willing to take the risk of believing in him when they first tried to escape the village. Shinji did try and connect with others throughout Eva, but the fear of making himself truly vulnerable always held him back. Simon is what would happen if Shinji was able to overcome that. Even the extreme optimism of Gurren Lagann in immediately rewarding Simon&#39;s faith with the best friend anyone could ever ask for is a fitting continuation from Evangelion&#39;s cynical realism. It&#39;s representative of the different perspective granted by hope and faith in yourself and others, of the change from fixating on the negative to celebrating the positive. Both shows are ultimately part of the same journey. <br>Also, as an aside, you take things too literally. The technobabble in Evangelion is every bit as irrelevant as it is in Gurren Lagann. That&#39;s a Gainax thing in general. The specific minutiae of the setting is never actually important and only exists to support the characters&#39; story. Ritsuko babbling off a bunch of nonsense is just handled more seriously because the show itself is more serious in tone. And Shinji choking Asuka in EoE isn&#39;t about him hating her. In that moment Asuka is the only other person on Earth. She is the representative of the &quot;other&quot; in contrast to Shinji&#39;s &quot;self&quot;. Shinji choking her after rejecting instrumentality is demonstrating that merely choosing to keep living and hoping doesn&#39;t magically fix everything instantly. Shinji&#39;s desire to connect with others is still complicated by his bitterness and incompetence at forming healthy relationships. And Asuka caressing Shinji&#39;s cheek followed by her disgusted remark maintain the promise of hope by showing that human connection isn&#39;t beyond reach while still remaining grounded in the reality that a change in outlook isn&#39;t going to stop people from feeling negative things towards you.",2,0,2023-07-08T01:53:32Z,0.0718159859464207,0.5302941422506641,0.165,0.683,0.152,-0.8478,54.32,10.69,1,fear

So Kamina did the <i>job</i> of Hero and Leader, essentially &quot;stealing the spotlight&quot; of the whole show until it literally killed him.  &quot;Who the hell do you think I am&quot;, in a way, can be taken to be asking, &quot;Do you <b>really</b> think I&#39;m the <i>Leader?</i>  Do you <b>really</b> think I&#39;m the <i>Main Character?</i>  No, Simon is the Main Character of this show, I&#39;m just his opening act!&quot;  And, thus, he keeps the &quot;seat warm&quot; until Simon is inspired enough to take up that Main Character mantle.<br>Kamina looks at the world through <b>literal</b> rose tinted glasses; but Nia&#39;s eyes are rose colored flowers.  She doesn&#39;t need to <i>wear</i> something extra to change how she sees the world; to her, the world <b>is</b> flowers, it <b>is</b> beautiful and rosy, even in its darkest and bleakest.  So both she and Kamina, each in their own way, inspire Simon to totally fulfill his Leadership and Heroic role in the story.<br>Amd it doesn&#39;t even stop there.  Simon, in turn inspires Kitan to become the &quot;Hero of His Own Story&quot;.  Kitan hijacks the Heroic Sacrifice role for himself, having been inspired by Simon, Kamina, and all the rest.  And that, in turn inspires others, <b>including</b> passing inspiration <i>back</i> to Simon.  Simon no longer sees the world <i>just</i> through rosy glasses, but Kitan&#39;s sacrifice forces him to <i>literally</i> &quot;look to the stars&quot; as he transforms the standard Wing-Glasses from Kamina into the Star-Glasses in honor of Kitan.  If he can&#39;t have &quot;stars in his eyes&quot;, he&#39;ll do the next best thing and wear them on his face.<br>And, by the end of the series, when his role as a Hero and as a Leader is over and done, he gets a moment of pure happiness, being able to marry Nia before she completely fades away.  He <i>absolutely</i> has the Spiral Power to bring her back, but that&#39;s <i>precisely</i> the danger the Anti-spiral had warned him about; unfettered, self-serving, irresponsible abuse of Spiral Power would eventually lead to the destruction of <b>everything.</b>  Who was he to say his and Nia&#39;s personal happiness was more important than the happiness of everyone else in the whole universe; after all, he&#39;s no God, he&#39;s just a digger.<br>And so, he in turn has inspired the next generation, handed the story off to the &quot;story untold&quot;.  And there never needed to be a &quot;next generation&quot; series, the likes of &quot;Boruto&quot; any more than we needed a prequel series that showed the origins of the previous war against the Anti-Spiral.  Because there&#39;s neither beginning nor end; it&#39;s an infinite, twisting path from past, through present, on to the future.

As a older bro i have the same mentality as him. Pushing my sibling to do better then me. Even if they are scared to take the leap..

Someone is just dead, but five minutes ago he wasn&#39;t. It&#39;s what happens next that actually defines the death: how you grieve. Anyone who had someone important for them like a relative or even a pet will agree, the heavy part is what you feel after the loss, not the moment itself. <br><br>This is something even some way more touching animes that revolve entirely around the emotions of death (Ano Hana, Your Lie In April) etc. Fail to communicate, in favor of just emphasize the sadness of a goodbye, which will be filled later.<br><br>When I first saw Nia, i was scared she was gonna be like &quot;Oh cool protagonist is dead, let&#39;s put a cute girl to fill the gap&quot; and holy shit was I happy to be wrong.<br><br>Even the ending, how even after saving the universe from space tyrants it wasn&#39;t enough to grant Simon a happy stereotypical life in the end, was so on point, it was just too good, and just like Kamina, Nia was gone in a flash, living behind only the memories she made with everyone. This is just telling you that Simon and Kamina are not special because they are the protagonists, but rather they were the protagonists because they are special.

That splinter in her relationship with Simon is absolutely fascinating and tragic. Which makes it all the more ripe for analysis.

But goes back to the point of we each have different roles to play in life, different times calls for different things.",15,0,2022-05-05T19:35:36Z,0.054040404040404,0.3986531986531987,0.056,0.87,0.075,0.2846,67.93,12.1,1,joy
UgxxZAwgbqSTXe5gTMh4AaABAg,@masterzero8561,It&#39;s funny I came to the conclusion the reason Simon disappeared was because he was tired and wanted to tap out and ride into the sunset.<br><br>Also the ending of the show kind of stumbles for me I don&#39;t like how Nia disappears at the very end if you ask me it wasn&#39;t foreshadowed at all and just reared its head at the last possible second and the reason they give for her disappearance I don&#39;t buy it all. You couldn&#39;t let the hero of the world disappear with the woman he loves you couldn&#39;t even give him that. It felt like it was put in solely for the sake to have a bittersweet ending.,3,3,2022-05-05T18:48:02Z,0.0928571428571428,0.5666666666666667,0.08,0.802,0.117,0.7783,67.93,13.86,1,anger
