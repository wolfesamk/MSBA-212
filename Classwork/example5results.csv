0,"Stella F.San Francisco, CA","Just came from there. Food is good. However; we Sat there, my daughter and my 88 year old mother to eat. Our food was put in styrofoam carriers, that were cracked.  Then, on their TV they had playing, 21 Jump street. Every other word was F...., G. D..., Etc.  I really don't want to hear that or explicit scenes while I'm eating out.",3
1,"Sarah S.Winters, CA","The food here is actually great...when you get your order. Twice in the last 3 months I've received the wrong order or nothing other than rice. I spent over $30 on food and left around a $10 tip because times are hard and they're working hard... and I thought they were customer oriented, but boy was I wrong. I called and got hung up on multiple times, just to see if I could pick up the food I ordered. After making over 40 call attempts... I finally got a ""sorry we're closed,"" and I simply said ""I already ordered and didn't get my food"" with her response of ""oh sorry, we're closed. No more,"" and again hung up on.",1
2,"Mary D.CA, CA","Walked in and there was no greeting and when my dad ordered there was no explanation of any kind of specials. My dad ordered the ribs, which to their credit were hot and tasty. However, the clamshell was PACKED with rice, and the salad was old, wilted, and tasteless. Table still had some rice on it and the restaurant itself was not very clean. Fountain beverage was flat. For $25.00 you would expect much better food and service, we will not be returning.",1
3,"Victoria G.Elite 2023Citrus Heights, CA","Didn't find this place to be anything special. I'd never go out of my way to go back here. Staff wasn't very friendly, didn't even greet me when I walked in. I ordered food to go which took about ten minutes. When I started eating I questioned it the chicken was fully cooked. The rice was the best part. The menu said it came with steamed veggies but it looked like just cooked bean sprouts and not appealing at all. The sesame chicken was over cooked and lacked flavor. The teriyaki chicken was pretty good but nothing special. The quality and amount of food seemed over priced as well. Wanted to try it once at least and just thought it was food, didn't wow me at all.",2
4,"Sonya  W.Capitola, CA","Terrible, terrible, terrible customer service. Unsanitary. Awful food! Left my teen niece upset and confused when she went to pay for our order. An Easy problem that could have been diffused, but instead was escalated by an aggressive, and defensive young man. (Perhaps it's the owner or owners kid by his demeanor). Last time I will come here. And recommend you not come here!",1
5,"Royce N.Sacramento, CA",I don't recommend eating here. I walked in. I wasn't impressed.Very dirty. The restaurant needs a face lift. The restaurant has open containers on the counter with no lids of Teriyaki sauce. I wasn't going to eat it. . No telling what is flying into the containers. The woman of the restaurant was walking around behind the counter with long unbrushed bleached hair. I walked out of there. Very unappetizing. Pass this place up up. Go to the one in Notomas. Much better.,1
6,"Geoff P.Woodland, CA","Update 10-2020:I just had a frustrating experience, but I'm not lowering my rating of this place.  I still love them all the same even though the owner was a bit snappy with me just now.  I can attest to the attitude people are describing in the other reviews.  He told me 15min on the phone and I arrived after 20 and waited another 10.  I only really felt trapped after I had paid, so in the future I think I will wait to pay until the food is done.  That way if the wait truly ends up being longer than I can handle, I have the ability to walk away.  Meal was still delicious BTW!  Worth the wait for sure.",5
7,"Joseph L.Orange, CA","One extra star only because chicken and veggies were pretty good...went in one hour before closing. Was told only chicken available because ""getting ready to close."" Since I was on a work road trip, wanted to eat in. Told no because ""closing soon.""I never am one to go somewhere right at closing (family was in restaurant biz so I try to be respectful) but 50 minutes before closing is crazy to say can not eat there. It's fast food that takes 10 minutes to eat.The place is also really dirty. I suspect the same owners have the sushi place next door which looked good but also closed way early.  Several customers were turned away.",5
8,"Amanda M.West Sacramento, CA","Staff is super nice and helpful. Large portions and almost always gets your order correct.The location could be a little cleaner and the staff could not discuss person lives so loud as the kitchen is open to the dining area.I would recommend the spicy chicken, I always get the sauce on the side as they seem to put a lot and I prefer my white rice plain. Go check em out, you won't be disappointed.",2
9,"Cynthia H.Sacramento, CA",We have always enjoyed the quick meal that we get from the I Love Teriyaki establishments around the Sacramento area.  We decided to go to the Woodland store for the first time just because we were there.  The food was horrible.  There is nothing more to say.  Do your own comparison. This place shouldn't even hold the name it's such a disgrace,4
10,"Greg G.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and potstickers.The potstickers were good. The sauce for them, not so much. The chicken was well done, burnt and tasted bland. The sauce for the teriyaki was basically enough for a quarter of the chicken. They gave a pile of rice and some kind of salad. The salad had a heavy hand of black pepper making the side not very enjoyable. There was some kind of red hot sauce that was decent. However, I would much rather have it on a burrito than on chicken teriyaki.The cutlery they gave was shit. The fork was fragile and wouldn't pick up the potstickers. I ended up grabbing some chopsticks from my work desk instead.",2
11,"Elba C.San Francisco, CA","they were in a hurry to close, I ordered my food to go at 730pm they close at 8pm the tall Asian looking guy basically threw the food at me when he said my order was ready. I had also order extra Sauce and was charged for it and they decided to give me an extra side of rice instead of the side salad they usually give and I was looking forward to that.. by the time I got home and realized there was no sauce or side salad no one answered.",2
12,"Susana Q.KNIGHTS LNDG, CA","This place really didn't do it for me today. I ordered the daily special (chicken teriyaki and spicy chicken) combo with no rice, extra veggies. The veggies are horrible; salty and soupy. The spicy chicken was laid over the veggies, making it soggy. The veggies are usually my favorite so I'm super disappointed. The spicy chicken isn't crispy and fresh, like usual. It's basically inedible and a waste of $10.99. Even my son is upset.",2
13,"Amber R.Elite 2023Woodland, CA",I have never had a bad meal from here. The wait time isn't very long as well. One of my favorites is the sesame seed chicken but literally anything else I have gotten has been amazing. Highly recommend this place!,5
14,"Scott N.Woodland, CA","Used to love coming here...now that they turn me away with 20 minutes left to closing never coming back. Very disappointed, it amazes me how they stay in business during this difficult time.",1
15,"Jason S.Elite 2023Boise, ID","I have been to several I Love Teriyaki locations and this one is the worst I have been to. I would like to give them a star for food quality but even that didn't come through yesterday. I went here for lunch after a meeting and upon walking in the place was pretty dead. I walk up to the counter and several employees chit chatting and what I would describe as a disgruntled family member stuffed into a medium shirt when it should've been a large or XL gives me this attitude that he will be with me in a minute while he does who knows what. Still employees chatting it up which again can't teach everyone what proper etiquette is...Finally now placing my order the attitude continues and all I asked was do you have just bowls and he smirky no just plates when he could've easily described it as the same for what you get served on a styrofoam plate. BTW who uses these anymore? I think we all know the environmental negatives around these items. Oh well that aside after completing my order and paying the clerk barely squeezes out a ""thanks""...now my favorite part once seated and order placed the clerk goes right outside to light up a cigarette which I don't care, but him hacking up lung butter and spitting it out right in front of the windows where the customers eat was a real treat. The food which he threw together right before he went out consisted of burnt chicken and totally underwhelming cabbage salad. Not to hard to get this one right, but you did. Based on the fact I hadn't eaten all day I choked this down 3/4 of the way then threw the rest away. After getting up and starting to walk out still 3-4 employees standing/sitting and now walking out and still no thank you. NP this customer will never be back...I know not when to repeat torture.",1
16,"Marty D.Sacramento, CA",I cannot explain how bad my experience was. Menu is totally different. Place is dirty.Cockroach crawling across the floor.As we are eating I look down and the cockroach is crawling across the floor. When I say something the lady that took our order just looks at it and keeps eating her food. the cook come from behind the counter and says it came from outside and closed the front door. His clothes are extremely dirty. Our experience was so bad my husband sat in the car for a bit trying not to get sick.,1
17,"Karina R.Woodland, CA",Everything I've tried is so good. I love this place. Super sweet family that own the place. Very fast service. Salmon teriyaki is my favorite. Mouthwatering. Must try,5
18,"Sarah D.San Rafael, CA",The deep fried spicy chicken is really good but my husbands teriyaki chicken was like rubber I'm giving this place 2 stars because I asked for soy sauce and hot sauce and this lady acted like I asked for a million dollars. She tossed it in my bag and pushed the bag towards me with a stank look on her face. So I will not be coming back,2
19,"John W.Roseville, CA",2nd time I ordered the crispy chicken with rice.  Both times were disappointing.  1st time they pour the spicy sauce all over the chicken and soaked the rice.  Not sure why they do that because it messes up the rice.  2nd time I ordered the crispy chicken this time with sauce on the side.  Problem this time is they over-fried the chicken!  Chicken tasted like cardboard!  They need to learn to cook.  Won't be ordering from here anymore.  Should be named I Hate Teriyaki.,1
