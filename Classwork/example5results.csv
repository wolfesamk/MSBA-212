1,"Jared S.Elite 2023Downtown, Sacramento, CA","I LOVE this place! Located in the heart of Midtown (Q and 19th to be exact), Pocha House has flavorful food and delicious drinks all in a fun, exciting environment. I got the Seoul whiskey drink and my fiancée got the ""peaches and cream."" Both were smooth, creative, and well thought cocktails. For food we split some fried rice, Korean fried chicken wings, and beef dumplings. DELICIOUS. So much flavor, and I loved the presentation! Service is spectacular. And the ambiance can't be beat. There's artwork and posters everywhere in this restaurant, with a bar and a DJ in the back (if you go later in the evening). Pocha House has one of the best vibes of any restaurant in Sacramento. I love restaurants that are an actual ""experience"" and not just ""food."" Pocha House is that. A++++++",4
2,"Jonah W.Elite 2023Brooklyn, NY","Was excited to learn about a new place in town that serves Tteokbokki. Came as a walk-in party of 2 on a Monday night and got seated right away although it was definitely busy. What hits you right away is the ~vibes~ of the place. The ambiance was definitely curated to evoke sort of an LA club vibe, with the dim lighting and neon signs making you feel like you're eating somewhere trendy. As a result, it seems like it attracts a younger crowd.Whether or not the vibes are your taste, the food itself delivers. I ordered the tteokbokki with ramen noodles and shared a kimchi pancake with my friend. The tteokbokki was very good and pretty big. It had plenty of rice cakes and fish cakes, and the sauce was flavorful. It was sweeter than other tteokbokki I've had, which was a little overwhelming at times but it also helped to balance out the spice. The kimchi pancake was not my favorite - too doughy and quickly became unappetizing after it cooled down.I'm very glad Pocha House came to Sac and I'm happy to have tried it, but I'm not sure I would return unless I'm specifically craving tteokbokki or unless they dialed down the clubby atmosphere. Would definitely recommend checking it out though!",4
3,"Caleb B.Natomas, Sacramento, CA","Looking for a bite to eat my family and I ran into Pocha House and decided to give it a shot.Located in midtown, parking is a bit inconvenient but not impossible to find along the street. On the outside the restaurant looks like a simple vintage brick house, but the inside has a completely different tone. The bright modern interior design is top notch, paired with a vibrant ambiance that elevates the dining experience. The only thing we noticed is there isn't a lot of proper seating, and some of the people in our party ended up sitting on stools.We were kindly greeted by a waitress who sat us down quickly. And checked on us several times throughout our meal.We ended up going with the Hot Cheetos Corn Cheese, Tteokbokki, Spicy Pork Bulgogi, and Fire Booty Booldak. All the plates had excellent taste and fair quantity. We definitely felt the Fire Booty Booldak needed more meat, as the tator tots completely dominated the dish. The Tteokbokki was one of the highlights, and we really enjoyed the rice cakes. Overall Pocha House had tasty food that we will likely return to in the future !",4
4,"Nareena V.Elite 2023San Jose, CA","I saw Pocha House on tiktok and I had to try it out! It's located in Midtown so parking can be a bit tough - luckily we found some street parking around the corner. The interior of the resturant is super cute! I also loved all the posters inside the bathroom. My friend and I came mainly for drinks. Definitely a bit pricey. I was also disappointed at the size of the large terra. Comparing to another Pocha in San Jose; the size was small for the price. But again, we came for the vibes.Food wise we order the soy garlic chicken and the pork belly salad. The chicken was crispy and flavorful. It came with a slaw, radish and pickled jalapeños. I loved the slaw sauce. The pork belly salad was a huge disappointment though - we love onions but it was just too strong of an onion flavor. There was also not that many pork belly slices.. I would definitely pass on this next time. The service here is also very good! Our server checked in with us often and was very nice. I would come again to try their other dishes. Hopefully a train passes by next time we're here!",4
5,"Trini L.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","This is the spot for drinks and appetizers! It is on the more pricier side though but it's definitely shareable! Really enjoyed the different dishes this restaurant has to offer, it's just like in a K-drama! We tried so many dishes and all of them were pretty delicious! I'd definitely come back here and take friends and family here. The only downside was we had to wait for extra chairs/seating since they were busy, kind of felt like they forgot about us.",5
6,"Paula C.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","Great ambiance, so relaxing. They have a bar and Korean food.We love this restaurant, the food was good and soju.This is our hangout spot to go too. YummmAlso fast service.Thank you",4
7,"Thuong N.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","I went to Pocha House with a few of my friends on a Friday night and was overall impressed by the food and service.9/10 Ambiance. This place gets very loud and lively at night. I thought it was the perfect atmosphere for a night out. I was very impressed by how fast the service was despite the crowd. We ordered our food/drinks and everything came out within 5-10 mins after the order was placed. ***I would definitely recommend going a bit earlier and adding your name to the waitlist as it can get quite busy. They will give you a text once your table is ready and you're free to hang out by the bar in the back while you wait.7.5/10 Food. Although a bit pricy, the food is quite good for a lounge/bar-type spot. I ordered a few things from the menu to try and my favorites were the Soy Garlic KFC Chicken and Bulgogi Fries. This is not a good place for a casual dinner or if you were looking to fuel up. This makes a much better occasion if you are looking to talk, drink, and have a few snacks while doing so.I definitely see myself coming back again in the future.",3
8,"Lisa S.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","Service: 5/5 Very nice on the phone, sweet and friendly in person, everyone had smiles and a great attitude. We thoroughly enjoyed every employee we encountered.Ambiance: 5/5Hip, live, dim, but not too much. The place was packed with people yet it didn't feel crowded because of how they had their tables spaced out. Nice open floor plan, with a nice full bar in the back. Great lighting.Food: 2.5/5Great options, but nothing memorable that'll bring us back. We ordered almost the whole menu. We love authentic Korean flavors from Korean grandmas and this was too modern for us. The kimchi was very salty. We were so sad because we wanted to like it so much!!! We love love love spicy, and nothing was spicy at all. Not even the fire booty buldak. Our 7 yr son, said it was sweet.My husband is Korean, so we frequent Mo Du Rang off of Folsom Blvd. in Sacramento. They have Korean Grandmas and mom's cooking in the back, they don't speak much English, but let me tell you, THEY CAN COOK SOME MEAN AUTHENTIC MEALS. We've been to almost every single Korean restaurant in the Sacramento region and around, and we always end up back at Mo Du Rang when the craving gets real.",5
9,"Athena M.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","Came here on a Saturday night around 7ish and it was about a 20min wait, they take down your number and send you a text when your table is ready. They might also give you the option to sit at the bar (if there is any room) if you don't want to wait for a table .. While waiting they informed us that we could go to the back of the restaurant to their other bar area & order some drinks while we wait. The second bar is not like the bar up in the front, they don't serve their specialty drinks instead you have to order drinks that you would get at any other bar.. We ordered their 4 shooter flight: peach soju with sour apple, lychee soju w/ blue curacao, pomegranate soju w/blood orange, strawberry soju w/ watermelon. To eat we ordered some fries and their Hot Cheetos corn cheese. It tasted great!We'll definitely have to be back to try out some more drinks and food!! I do love the vibe of this place!! Super chill and laid back.. They also play great music!",4
10,"Ivy Q.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","The first time I came to dine in it was almost an hour wait. I came back maybe about a month later for dinner on a Sunday & there was no wait. Tiktok hyped this place up for sure! The aesthetics of this place was nice! The dining room was smaller than I expected but they have a bar on the back side (hence why they're open till 2am). The restroom had to be my favorite haha. Dim lights with neon sign to brightens the place. I also liked their collage wall of Korean and hip hop artists. Also a nice big mirror for you to check yourself out of get some flicks.Pork belly salad: it's alright. The pork belly was pretty much pan fried and peppered. I ordered this because I needed some veggies with my meal. Recommend if you enjoy eating veggies & having a fresh bite in between other foods.Corn cheese: good flavor but not toasty or melted to my liking. They blow torch the cheese in front of you when it is served to your table. That was a cool experience.Bulgogi fries: had to be my fave. The meat was seasoned well and the other sauces on top was a nice touch flavor when taking a bite. Makes the bite bit dry.Spicy wings: not spicy at all lol. Get it if you can't handle spice. You'll be okay. Flavorful, breading was decent. My 2nd fave of what we ordered.Alcohol: $2 shots when train passes by! I don't think they limit you to how many you want, but you walk up to the bar when ordering. 1 order per train. Waiter said we were lucky to be there when it happened. Not sure how often a train comes by but it was also another fun experience with the dine in. You can feel the rumble of the train too. Good business tactic they came up with.Overall, it was only okay for me. I felt like all my food came to our table cold. Nothing was warm and seemed like it was prepped ahead of time and had been sitting there.",4
11,"Vanessa L.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","Came on a Monday night and the restaurant was pretty filled up. Since it's just their soft opening, their menu is still limited and they have several ""coming soon"" items that are not available yet. We ordered the soy garlic KFC, kimchi karbonara, and the donkasu. Soy garlic was pretty good. It was nice and crispy. I just wasn't a fan of the side of shredded cabbage that it came with. I wish it came with something else. Even just a reg side of salad with vinaigrette or asian dressing would be better imo. The kimchi karbonara was good as well and I loved the bacon on it but it needed a lil bit more noodles. The donkasu was ok but had a nice portion. Drinks:Mo matcha - very cucumbery. It was good and had a hint of matcha in it Purple reign - get this if you like gin & strong drinksPurple Venom - this was really good. Highly recommend if you like sweet drinks Service was good. Our server was really nice and gave us recommendations on what to get. I will def be back to try more food once they have their grand opening.",4
12,"Kevin N.Elite 2023Elk Grove, CA",Had to check out this new Korean bar in downtown sACRAMENTO! The wings were so delicious and the hot Cheetos corn cheese was my favorites! The drinks were good and strong and had the perfect names for the cocktails!Some of the food was just okay but def go for the drinks and the wings and cheese corn! We went during lunch time so we got the best service since not many people were there so the servers were tentative!,4
13,"Mel E.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA",Delicious flavors & loved the lively ambiance! First time here a few weeks ago and we had a great time. Off the bat we were warmly greeted by our hostess and server who were both helpful in suggesting popular dishes. The menu had a few blocked off items that we were hoping to try but I'm assuming once they're a little more established they will introduce those items to the menu.  My bf and I enjoyed  the Teokbokki w/ added ramen & cheese. We also ordered the Fire Booty Booldak which was my bf's favorite. The portions are huge! This would be a great place to try with a larger crowd. Next time we plan to come back with friends and order a larger variety dishes! I'm looking forward to their kimchi Karbonara.,3
14,"Annie Y.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","3.5 stars overallTo start off on a good note. The service was excellent. I forgot her name but our waitress was super sweet, funny and attentive. She came back to fill our water jug and checked on us often but not the annoying type. 5/5Some items on the menu are not available yet due to soft opening, but a good selection. It was three of us so we decided to do family style and order a bunch of dishes to share. Kimchi Pancake was a bit disappointing. It was savory but it was ultra thin. I was expecting pancake not flatbread. The bulgogi was okay, nothing memorable. The Soy Garlic KFC was probably the most tasty dish, similar to Banchon fried chicken (iykyk). The Bulgogi Fries needed more sauce or meat or dipping sauce on the side? It was very dry. 3/5.Several cocktails are with soju. I personally think soju is very sweet. I went with the Pink Venom and ask for less sweet. I didn't like it. I thought I was sipping cough syrup like liquid. My fault - I should have went with a draft beer instead. 3/5. The vibe was lively and cool decor with the LED signs. I think this is more of ""let's get a drink"" kind of place, especially they closed at 2AM!",5
15,"Lizz V.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","This place is a vibe. Came on a Sunday evening once and it was lively. I almost forgot it was a Sunday. Came another time on a Saturday and vibes remain the same. Lively but calm and not rowdy.Waiters and waitresses are attentive and friendly. They come around often but not too much where they're bothering you. They all have good attitude. Trina has served us both times while we're there and she is theee best!!! Food is always a hit for us. Our favorite is their Korean fried chicken, kimchi fried rice(tad bit more moist to what I'd prefer) but nothing overly doing it so it's fine, and fire booty booldak is tasty. Full of flavors. I wouldn't consider this as fine dining, it's more of a casual/mingle spot for bites and drinks. They don't have a parking lot to this restaurant other than side street parking. If you're going closer to the evening you should have no problem.",5
16,"Tyler K.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA",Pocha is a new and electric restaurant/bar! I love that they have a bar in the back for people to mingle and socialize while waiting for their table. The food is spicy so keep that in mind if your spice tolerance is low! The food is perfect for a night out with some drinks and is definitely not meant to be fancy fare. Hope to see this place continue to thrive!,4
17,"Tiffany L.Elite 2023CA, CA","Pocha House has been the new place to try and finally tried it with friends for dinner. We all shared and got Bulgogi Fries, Kimchi Fried Rice, Tteokbokki + Ramen Noodle, Kimchi Karbonara, Fried Gizzards, and Soy Garlic KFC. My friends did order some of their speciality drinks and they were pretty tasty! I'd say a must is the Fried Gizzards. Everything else is pretty standard. The food is pretty expensive, but I do think it's a cool place to go get some small bits and even drinks with friends. The environment definitely elevates the place. I will say when it's hot, it's HOT inside. The temperature is probably one of flaws of Pocha House. Please note, they do have a time limit of an hour. I hope they do change this because it makes things seem rushed. I understand the place is popular and they try to seat all their guest timely, but it's a pretty short time frame if you're coming with multiple peoples. I definitely would come back for the fried gizzards!",4
18,"Jasmine C.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","During my visit to Pocha House for a book club meet-up, I was impressed by the welcoming attitude of the employees despite our group being 10 minutes late. The vibrant and colorful ambiance inside the restaurant added to the overall experience, especially with the hip-hop and Bay Area music playing in the background.However, I have to admit that I was disappointed with the Shin Ramen I ordered; it didn't stand out and tasted like regular top ramen. On the bright side, the Bulgogi fries were a delightful surprise with their tasty and tender meat. The kimchi fried rice was also a hit among our group.Moving on to the spicy dishes, the fire booty Boodak delivered on the heat and flavor, and the Tteokbokki had a nice balance of spiciness and sweetness, especially after adding ramen to it.What pleasantly surprised me the most was the hot Cheetos corn cheese, which turned out to be a unique and delicious combination. The sweetness complemented the hot Cheetos, corn, and cheese exceptionally well.Overall, we had a great time at Pocha House, and I'll definitely be returning in the future.",4
19,"Lisa N.Elite 2023San Jose, CA","This is THE spot to check out for late night eats in Sacramento! Cool hip spot for some Korean food and hanging out with friends. The atmosphere was very lively and fun! The food selection here looked and tasted so good!! Love how they stay open until 2am (kitchen closes at midnight). We got there at 10pm and were put on a waitlist. Only had to wait about 15 minutes. Servers were all friendly and attentive. S/O to Justine, she was very helpful and personable. Spam kimchi fried rice -- generous portion and perfectly cooked fried egg.Soy garlic korean fried chicken -- just wish the chicken pieces were a bit bigger. Not the best but not bad. Still good soy garlic flavor. Strawberry Soju was a great pairing with the food. Yum!Mandu -- dumplings were nice and crispy. Overall, I really enjoyed this spot and recommend.",4
