49," Get ready for an adrenaline-packed weekend that captures the essence of startup life! The Startup Challenge is back on October 13-15, 2023. This isn't your average weekend event; it's a whirlwind of creativity, high-energy competition, and hands-on experience. Over the course of just three days, you'll transform a mere idea into a real startup, guided by mentors and fueled by passion. The motto is simple: it's not a weekend of talk; it's a weekend of doing. On Friday, October 13th, the event kicks off with a gathering filled with networking, dinner, and the chance to connect with like-minded entrepreneurs from the Sacramento ecosystem. Have an idea you've been itching to bring to life? You get a quick 60 seconds at the microphone to pitch it. The catch? It must be entirely new, with no prior work done - no websites, products, customers, logos, nada. Don't want to pitch? No problem! You can join a team later.After all the pitches, you'll vote for your favorite ideas, and teams will form around the most popular ones. Sometimes, you might find yourself working on someone else's idea, and that's perfectly fine. Remember, startups aren't just about the idea - it's all about execution! With an idea and a team, it's time to roll up your sleeves. You have less than 48 hours to turn your concept into a bona fide business. It might sound daunting, but that's precisely why the Startup Challenge is designed for you. Your hard work culminates on Sunday night, where your team will present your new business in front of a panel of judges. And yes, there are amazing prizes on the line, including cash! Remember, it's not just about having a good idea; it's about gaining traction. So, mark your calendars for October 13-15, 2023, and join us for a weekend of DOING innovation and startups!Register Here: https://lnkd.in/gX5iM-J5#StartupChallenge #StartToday #TakeActionCarlsen Center for Innovation & Entrepreneurship City of Sacramento StartupSac The Right Box LLC Sacramento Entrepreneurship Academy 1 Million Cups Sacramento Sacramento Entrepreneurial Growth Alliance The Hive CSUS Sacramento State College of Business Administration Sacramento State EMBAArlene J.
