0,Somewhere I Belong,"(When this began) I had nothin' to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
And I've got nothin' to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Lookin' everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is lookin' at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothin' to gain, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

I will break away, I'll find myself today

1,Faint,"I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watchin' you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface

Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fuckin' mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rollin' in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignorin' him?

With flames in my hands

Between yours and mine

My flag had to fall
But little did you know

Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've

[Verse 3: Rakim]
Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of bein' rich but the bosses' plans is wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split, nonsense
It's insane, even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty
At anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowin' as soon as the dough or the deal peak
Say it's time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it's more to gain drained, manipulated like artists
It's real deep, until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock 'til pop and radio
And record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be?
You feel me, we'll see that green could be to blame or greedy for the fame
TV or a name, the Media, the game
To me you're all the same, you're guilty

You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
