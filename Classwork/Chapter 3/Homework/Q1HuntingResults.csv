0,A Line in the Sand,"Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun
We laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they, they told us to go
We paid them no mind
Like every other time
But little did we know

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
Today, I looked for a sign
With flames in my hands
A line in the sand
Between yours and mine
And it came like fire from below
Your greed led the call
My flag had to fall
But little did you know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've
Pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours and face your crime
You'll tell them, ""Give me back what's mine""
""Give me back what's mine!""

I'd never been a coward, I'd never seen blood
You'd sold me an ocean, and I was lost in the flood
We were countin' on a leader, we were driven by need
But couldn't take temptation, and we were blinded by greed
You were steady as a sniper, we were waitin' on a wire
So we never saw it comin' when you ran from the fire
You can try intimidation and you can try to ignore
But when the time comes callin', yeah, you are gonna get yours

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've
Pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours and face your crime
You'll tell them, ""Give me back what's mine""
""Give me back what's mine!""

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And so today, your truth has come
You're gonna pay for what you've
Pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours, you're out of time
And you will give me back what's mine
Give me back what's mine!
[Post-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Give me, give me back what's mine!
Give me, give me back what's mine!
What's mine!
Give me, give me back what's mine!
What's mine! What's mine!
Give me back what's mine!

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun
We laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they, they told us to go
We paid them no mind
Like every other time

1,Guilty All the Same (feat. Rakim),"
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Tell us all again what you think we should be
What the answers are, what it is we can't see
Tell us all again how to do what you say
How to fall in line, how there's no other way

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
But oh-oh, we all know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Show us all again, that our hands are unclean
That we're unprepared, that you have what we need
Show us all again 'cause we cannot be saved
'Cause the end is near, now there's no other way

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And oh-oh, you will know
You might also like[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame, guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
You're guilty all the same

[Verse 3: Rakim]
Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of bein' rich but the bosses' plans is wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split, nonsense
It's insane, even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty
At anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowin' as soon as the dough or the deal peak
Say it's time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it's more to gain drained, manipulated like artists
It's real deep, until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock 'til pop and radio
And record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be?
You feel me, we'll see that green could be to blame or greedy for the fame
TV or a name, the Media, the game
To me you're all the same, you're guilty
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame, guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
So what'cha waitin' for, anticipatin' more
While you debate what it could take to instigate a war?
Yeah, I been hated more than time I wasn't hated for
There's nothing they can fuckin' say they didn't say before

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
But you could never see it, your battle's not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe, but this is take a shot time
While you're waitin' for a purpose, I already got mine
While you tell me step to it like ""one, two, three, four""

[Chorus: Page Hamilton & Chester Bennington]
And if I do what you demand
(You say!) You'll let me understand
