0,Somewhere I Belong,"(When this began) I had nothin' to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
And I've got nothin' to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Lookin' everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is lookin' at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothin' to gain, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm
Somewhere I belong
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm
Somewhere I belong

1,Faint,"I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watchin' you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

No, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now

2,Breaking the Habit,"Memories consume like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Verse 2]
Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose

I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Bridge]
I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight76Embed",anger
3,Numb,"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be198Embed",fear
