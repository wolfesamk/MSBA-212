0,The Little Things Give You Away,"Water grey
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean, everywhere

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breakin'

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
But now there will be no mistakin'
The levees are breakin'

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underground
Now I, now I do

[Guitar Solo: Brad Delson]

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]

1,Given Up,"Wake in a sweat again
Another day's been laid to waste, in my disgrace
Stuck in my head again
Feels like I'll never leave this place, there's no escape

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm my own worst enemy

[Chorus]
I've given up, I'm sick of feelin'
Is there nothin' you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocatin'
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

[Verse 2]
I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused but I'm scared, I'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Lookin' for help somehow, somewhere and no one cares

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm my own worst enemy

[Chorus]
I've given up, I'm sick of feelin'
Is there nothin' you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocatin'
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

God!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my, put me out of my
Fucking misery!

[Chorus]
I've given up, I'm sick of feelin'
Is there nothin' you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocatin'
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me36Embed"
2,Bleed It Out,"Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fuckin' mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rollin' in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignorin' him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this!
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out
I bleed it out55Embed"
