    14 ContributorsAshes Lyrics[Intro]
    Right
    Hate, hate, hate!
    Bring it!
    
    [Verse 1]
    You don't understand...","Right
Hate, hate, hate!
Bring it!

[Verse 1]
You don't understand me
And you probably never will
I got a tendency to self-destruct
And a soft spot for the filth
A hair-trigger temperament
A switchblade for a tongue
I'm a walking one-man genocide
With a black belt in corrupt

[Chorus 1]
Everything I touch turns to ashes
Falls away, it falls away
Everything I touch turns to ashes
It slips right through my hands

[Chorus 2]
Love me, hate me
Isolate me every day that I'm alive
Straight-up mentally unstable
You don't have to like my life
You might also like[Verse 2]
I'm a jinx, a curse; some say, ""The worst""
I'm a savage, rabid beast
I've been called so many fucking things
It doesn't affect me in the least!
I've stolen, lied, been crucified
But I don't regret a thing
I'm an egocentric masochist
With a sadist's point of bleak

[Chorus]
Everything I touch turns to ashes
Falls away, it falls away
Everything I touch turns to ashes
It slips right through my hands

[Chorus 2]
Love me, hate me
Isolate me every day that I'm alive
Live to prove you wrong, it's easy
When your heart is filled with ice
Chapters in my life define me
Changed me into this deprived
Straight-up mentally unstable
You don't have to like my life
[Outro]
Everything I touch turns to ashes
Falls away, it falls away
Everything I touch turns to ashes
It slips right through my hands1Embed"

    Remem...","Lies!

[Verse 1]
I remember when all the games began
Remember every little lie (Every little lie) and every last goodbye
Promises you broke, words you choked on
And I never walked away (Never walked away)
It's still a mystery to me
Well, I'm so empty
I'm better off without you and you're better off without me
Well, you're so unclean!
I'm better off without you and you're better off without me!
(Right!)

[Chorus]
The lying, the bleeding, the screaming!
Was tearing me apart!
The hatred, deceiving, the beatings; it's over!

[Verse 2]
Paint the mirrors black to forget you
I still picture your face (Still picture your face)
And the way you used to taste (Way you used to taste)
Roses in a glass, dead and wilted
To you, this all was nothing, everything to you is nothing
Well, you're so filthy
I'm better off without you and you're better off without me
Well, I'm so ugly!
You're better off without me and I'm better off alone!
(Right!)

You're my perfect disease!

The lying, the bleeding, the screaming!
Was tearing me apart!
The hatred, the beatings; it's over! Disaster!
The lying, the bleeding, the screaming!
Was tearing me apart!
The hatred, the beatings; it's over! Disaster!

Another night settles in as quickly as it goes
The memories of shadows, ink on the page

Your heaven's trying everything

A million stories that made up a million shattered dreams
The faces of people I'll never see again

To eat with the beast and run with the wolves
