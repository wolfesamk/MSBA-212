      "(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n",

      "The biographer is now faced with a difficulty which it is better perhaps to confess than to gloss over. Up to this point in telling the story of Orlando's life, documents, both private and historical, have made it possible to fulfil the first duty of a biographer, which is to plod, without looking to right or left, in the indelible footprints of truth; unenticed by flowers; regardless of shade; on and on methodically till we fall plump into the grave and write finis on the tombstone above our heads. But now we come to an episode which lies right across our path, so that there is no ignoring it. Yet it is dark, mysterious, and undocumented; so that there is no explaining it. Volumes might be written in interpretation of it; whole religious systems founded upon the signification of it. Our simple duty is to state the facts as far as they are known, and so let the reader make of them what he may.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the summer of that disastrous winter which saw the frost, the flood, the deaths of many thousands, and the complete downfall of Orlando's hopes--for he was exiled from Court; in deep disgrace with the most powerful nobles of his time; the Irish house of Desmond was justly enraged; the King had already trouble enough with the Irish not to relish this further addition--in that summer Orlando retired to his great house in the country and there lived in complete solitude. One June morning--it was Saturday the 18th--he failed to rise at his usual hour, and when his\n",
      "groom went to call him he was found fast asleep. Nor could he be\n",
      "awakened. He lay as if in a trance, without perceptible breathing; and though dogs were set to bark under his window; cymbals, drums, bones beaten perpetually in his room; a gorse bush put under his pillow; and mustard plasters applied to his feet, still he did not wake, take food, or show any sign of life for seven whole days. On the seventh day he woke at his usual time (a quarter before eight, precisely) and turned the whole posse of caterwauling wives and village soothsayers out of his room, which was natural enough; but what was strange was that he showed\n",
      "no consciousness of any such trance, but dressed himself and sent for his horse as if he had woken from a single night's slumber. Yet some change, it was suspected, must have taken place in the chambers of his brain, for though he was perfectly rational and seemed graver and more sedate in his ways than before, he appeared to have an imperfect recollection of his past life. He would listen when people spoke of the great frost or the skating or the carnival, but he never gave any sign, except by passing\n",
      "his hand across his brow as if to wipe away some cloud, of having\n",
      "witnessed them himself. When the events of the past six months were discussed, he seemed not so much distressed as puzzled, as if he were troubled by confused memories of some time long gone or were trying to recall stories told him by another. It was observed that if Russia was mentioned or Princesses or ships, he would fall into a gloom of an uneasy kind and get up and look out of the window or call one of the dogs to him, or take a knife and carve a piece of cedar wood. But the doctors were hardly wiser then than they are now, and after prescribing rest and exercise, starvation and nourishment, society and solitude, that he should lie in bed all day and ride forty miles between lunch and dinner,\n",
      "together with the usual sedatives and irritants, diversified, as the\n",
      "fancy took them, with possets of newt's slobber on rising, and draughts of peacock's gall on going to bed, they left him to himself, and gave it as their opinion that he had been asleep for a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if sleep it was, of what nature, we can scarcely refrain from asking, are such sleeps as these? Are they remedial measures--trances in which the most galling memories, events that seem likely to cripple life for ever, are brushed with a dark wing which rubs their harshness off and gilds them, even the ugliest and basest, with a lustre, an incandescence? Has the finger of death to be laid on the tumult of life from time to time lest it rend us asunder? Are we so made that we have to take death in small doses daily or we could not go on with the business of living? And then what strange powers are these that penetrate our most secret ways and change our most treasured possessions without our willing it? Had Orlando, worn out by the extremity of his suffering, died for a week, and then come to life again? And if so, of what nature is death and of what nature life? Having waited well over half an hour for an answer to these questions, and none coming, let us get on with the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Orlando gave himself up to a life of extreme solitude. His disgrace at Court and the violence of his grief were partly the reason of it, but as he made no effort to defend himself and seldom invited anyone to visit him (though he had many friends who would willingly have done so) it appeared as if to be alone in the great house of his fathers suited his temper. Solitude was his choice. How he spent his time, nobody quite knew. The servants, of whom he kept a full retinue, though much of their business was to dust empty rooms and to smooth the coverlets of beds that\n",
      "were never slept in, watched, in the dark of the evening, as they sat over their cakes and ale, a light passing along the galleries, through the banqueting-halls, up the staircase, into the bedrooms, and knew that their master was perambulating the house alone. None dared follow him, for the house was haunted by a great variety of ghosts, and the extent of it made it easy to lose one's way and either fall down some hidden staircase or open a door which, should the wind blow it to, would shut upon one for ever--accidents of no uncommon occurrence, as the frequent discovery of the skeletons of men and animals in attitudes of great agony made evident. Then the light would be lost altogether, and Mrs Grimsditch, the housekeeper, would say to Mr Dupper, the chaplain, how she hoped his Lordship had not met with some bad accident. Mr Dupper would opine that his Lordship was on his knees, no doubt, among the tombs of his ancestors in the Chapel, which was in the Billiard Table Court, half a mile away on the south side. For he had sins on his conscience, Mr Dupper was afraid; upon which Mrs Grimsditch would retort, rather sharply, that so had most of us; and Mrs Stewkley and Mrs Field and old Nurse Carpenter would all  raise their voices in his Lordship's praise; and the grooms and the stewards would swear that it was a thousand pities to see so fine a nobleman moping about the house when he might be hunting the fox or chasing the deer; and even the little laundry maids and scullery maids, the Judys and the Faiths, who were handing round the tankards and cakes, would pipe up their testimony to his Lordship's gallantry; for never was there a kinder gentleman, or one more free with those little pieces of silver which serve to buy a knot of ribbon or put a posy in one's hair; until even the Blackamoor whom they called Grace Robinson by way of making a Christian woman of her, understood what they were at, and agreed that his Lordship was a handsome, pleasant, darling gentleman in the only way she could, that is to say by showing all her teeth at once in a broad grin. In short, all his serving men and women held him in high respect, and cursed the foreign Princess (but they called her by a coarser name than that) who had brought him to this pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "But though it was probably cowardice, or love of hot ale, that led Mr Dupper to imagine his Lordship safe among the tombs so that he need not go in search of him, it may well have been that Mr Dupper was right. Orlando now took a strange delight in thoughts of death and decay, and, after pacing the long galleries and ballrooms with a taper in his hand, looking at picture after picture as if he sought the likeness of somebody whom he could not find, would mount into the family pew and sit for hours watching the banners stir and the moonlight waver with a bat or death's head moth to keep him company. Even this was not enough for him, but he must descend into the crypt where his ancestors lay, coffin piled upon coffin, for ten generations together. The place was so seldom visited that the rats made free with the lead work, and now a thigh bone would catch at his cloak as he passed, or he would crack the skull of some old Sir Malise as it rolled beneath his foot. It was a ghastly sepulchre; dug deep beneath the foundations of the house as if the first Lord of the family, who had come from France with the Conqueror, had wished to testify how all pomp is built upon corruption; how the skeleton lies beneath the flesh: how we that dance and sing above must lie below; how the crimson velvet turns to dust; how the ring (here Orlando, stooping his lantern, would pick up a gold circle lacking a stone, that had rolled into a corner) loses its ruby and the eye which was so lustrous shines no more. 'Nothing remains of all these Princes', Orlando would say, indulging in some pardonable exaggeration of their rank, 'except one digit,' and he would take a skeleton hand in his and bend the joints this way and that. 'Whose hand was it?' he went on to ask. 'The right or the left? The hand of man or woman, of age or youth? Had it urged the war horse, or plied the needle? Had it plucked the rose, or grasped cold steel? Had it--' but here either his invention failed him or, what is more likely, provided him with so many instances of what a hand can do that he shrank, as his wont was, from the cardinal labour of composition, which is excision, and he put it with the other bones, thinking how there was a writer called Thomas Browne, a Doctor of Norwich, whose writing upon such subjects took his fancy amazingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, taking his lantern and seeing that the bones were in order, for\n",
      "though romantic, he was singularly methodical and detested nothing so\n",
      "much as a ball of string on the floor, let alone the skull of an\n",
      "ancestor, he returned to that curious, moody pacing down the galleries,\n",
      "looking for something among the pictures, which was interrupted at length\n",
      "by a veritable spasm of sobbing, at the sight of a Dutch snow scene by an\n",
      "unknown artist. Then it seemed to him that life was not worth living any\n",
      "more. Forgetting the bones of his ancestors and how life is founded on a\n",
      "grave, he stood there shaken with sobs, all for the desire of a woman in\n",
      "Russian trousers, with slanting eyes, a pouting mouth and pearls about\n",
      "her neck. She had gone. She had left him. He was never to see her again.\n",
      "And so he sobbed. And so he found his way back to his own rooms; and Mrs\n",
      "Grimsditch, seeing the light in the window, put the tankard from her lips\n",
      "and said Praise be to God, his Lordship was safe in his room again; for\n",
      "she had been thinking all this while that he was foully murdered.\n",
      "Orlando now drew his chair up to the table; opened the works of Sir\n",
      "Thomas Browne and proceeded to investigate the delicate articulation of\n",
      "one of the doctor's longest and most marvellously contorted cogitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "For though these are not matters on which a biographer can profitably\n",
      "enlarge it is plain enough to those who have done a reader's part in\n",
      "making up from bare hints dropped here and there the whole boundary and\n",
      "circumference of a living person; can hear in what we only whisper a\n",
      "living voice; can see, often when we say nothing about it, exactly what\n",
      "he looked like; know without a word to guide them precisely what he\n",
      "thought--and it is for readers such as these that we write--it is plain\n",
      "then to such a reader that Orlando was strangely compounded of many\n",
      "humours--of melancholy, of indolence, of passion, of love of solitude, to\n",
      "say nothing of all those contortions and subtleties of temper which were\n",
      "indicated on the first page, when he slashed at a dead nigger's head; cut\n",
      "it down; hung it chivalrously out of his reach again and then betook\n",
      "himself to the windowseat with a book. The taste for books was an early\n",
      "one. As a child he was sometimes found at midnight by a page still\n",
      "reading. They took his taper away, and he bred glow-worms to serve his\n",
      "purpose. They took the glow-worms away, and he almost burnt the house\n",
      "down with a tinder. To put it in a nutshell, leaving the novelist to\n",
      "smooth out the crumpled silk and all its implications, he was a nobleman\n",
      "afflicted with a love of literature. Many people of his time, still more\n",
      "of his rank, escaped the infection and were thus free to run or ride or\n",
      "make love at their own sweet will. But some were early infected by a germ\n",
      "said to be bred of the pollen of the asphodel and to be blown out of\n",
      "Greece and Italy, which was of so deadly a nature that it would shake the\n",
      "hand as it was raised to strike, and cloud the eye as it sought its prey,\n",
      "and make the tongue stammer as it declared its love. It was the fatal\n",
      "nature of this disease to substitute a phantom for reality, so that\n",
      "Orlando, to whom fortune had given every gift--plate, linen, houses,\n",
      "men-servants, carpets, beds in profusion--had only to open a book for the\n",
      "whole vast accumulation to turn to mist. The nine acres of stone which\n",
      "were his house vanished; one hundred and fifty indoor servants\n",
      "disappeared; his eighty riding horses became invisible; it would take too\n",
      "long to count the carpets, sofas, trappings, china, plate, cruets,\n",
      "chafing dishes and other movables often of beaten gold, which evaporated\n",
      "like so much sea mist under the miasma. So it was, and Orlando would sit\n",
      "by himself, reading, a naked man.\n",
      "The disease gained rapidly upon him now in his solitude. He would read\n",
      "often six hours into the night; and when they came to him for orders\n",
      "about the slaughtering of cattle or the harvesting of wheat, he would\n",
      "push away his folio and look as if he did not understand what was said to\n",
      "him. This was bad enough and wrung the hearts of Hall, the falconer, of\n",
      "Giles, the groom, of Mrs Grimsditch, the housekeeper, of Mr Dupper, the\n",
      "chaplain. A fine gentleman like that, they said, had no need of books.\n",
      "Let him leave books, they said, to the palsied or the dying. But worse\n",
      "was to come. For once the disease of reading has laid upon the system it\n",
      "weakens it so that it falls an easy prey to that other scourge which\n",
      "dwells in the inkpot and festers in the quill. The wretch takes to\n",
      "writing. And while this is bad enough in a poor man, whose only property\n",
      "is a chair and a table set beneath a leaky roof--for he has not much to\n",
      "lose, after all--the plight of a rich man, who has houses and cattle,\n",
      "maidservants, asses and linen, and yet writes books, is pitiable in the\n",
      "extreme. The flavour of it all goes out of him; he is riddled by hot\n",
      "irons; gnawed by vermin. He would give every penny he has (such is the\n",
      "malignity of the germ) to write one little book and become famous; yet\n",
      "all the gold in Peru will not buy him the treasure of a well-turned line.\n",
      "So he falls into consumption and sickness, blows his brains out, turns\n",
      "his face to the wall. It matters not in what attitude they find him. He\n",
      "has passed through the gates of Death and known the flames of Hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Happily, Orlando was of a strong constitution and the disease (for\n",
      "reasons presently to be given) never broke him down as it has broken many\n",
      "of his peers. But he was deeply smitten with it, as the sequel shows. For\n",
      "when he had read for an hour or so in Sir Thomas Browne, and the bark of\n",
      "the stag and the call of the night watchman showed that it was the dead\n",
      "of night and all safe asleep, he crossed the room, took a silver key from\n",
      "his pocket and unlocked the doors of a great inlaid cabinet which stood\n",
      "in the corner. Within were some fifty drawers of cedar wood and upon each\n",
      "was a paper neatly written in Orlando's hand. He paused, as if hesitating\n",
      "which to open. One was inscribed 'The Death of Ajax', another 'The Birth\n",
      "of Pyramus', another 'Iphigenia in Aulis', another 'The Death of\n",
      "Hippolytus', another 'Meleager', another 'The Return of Odysseus',--in\n",
      "fact there was scarcely a single drawer that lacked the name of some\n",
      "mythological personage at a crisis of his career. In each drawer lay a\n",
      "document of considerable size all written over in Orlando's hand. The\n",
      "truth was that Orlando had been afflicted thus for many years. Never had\n",
      "any boy begged apples as Orlando begged paper; nor sweetmeats as he\n",
      "begged ink. Stealing away from talk and games, he had hidden himself\n",
      "behind curtains, in priest's holes, or in the cupboard behind his\n",
      "mother's bedroom which had a great hole in the floor and smelt horribly\n",
      "of starling's dung, with an inkhorn in one hand, a pen in another, and on\n",
      "his knee a roll of paper. Thus had been written, before he was turned\n",
      "twenty-five, some forty-seven plays, histories, romances, poems; some in\n",
      "prose, some in verse; some in French, some in Italian; all romantic, and\n",
      "all long. One he had had printed by John Ball of the Feathers and Coronet\n",
      "opposite St Paul's Cross, Cheapside; but though the sight of it gave him\n",
      "extreme delight, he had never dared show it even to his mother, since to\n",
      "write, much more to publish, was, he knew, for a nobleman an inexpiable\n",
      "disgrace.\n",
      "Now, however, that it was the dead of night and he was alone, he chose\n",
      "from this repository one thick document called 'Xenophila a Tragedy' or\n",
      "some such title, and one thin one, called simply 'The Oak Tree' (this was\n",
      "the only monosyllabic title among the lot), and then he approached the\n",
      "inkhorn, fingered the quill, and made other such passes as those addicted\n",
      "to this vice begin their rites with. But he paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "As this pause was of extreme significance in his history, more so,\n",
      "indeed, than many acts which bring men to their knees and make rivers run\n",
      "with blood, it behoves us to ask why he paused; and to reply, after due\n",
      "reflection, that it was for some such reason as this. Nature, who has\n",
      "played so many queer tricks upon us, making us so unequally of clay and\n",
      "diamonds, of rainbow and granite, and stuffed them into a case, often of\n",
      "the most incongruous, for the poet has a butcher's face and the butcher a\n",
      "poet's; nature, who delights in muddle and mystery, so that even now (the\n",
      "first of November 1927) we know not why we go upstairs, or why we come\n",
      "down again, our most daily movements are like the passage of a ship on an\n",
      "unknown sea, and the sailors at the mast-head ask, pointing their glasses\n",
      "to the horizon; Is there land or is there none? to which, if we are\n",
      "prophets, we make answer 'Yes'; if we are truthful we say 'No'; nature,\n",
      "who has so much to answer for besides the perhaps unwieldy length of this\n",
      "sentence, has further complicated her task and added to our confusion by\n",
      "providing not only a perfect rag-bag of odds and ends within us--a piece\n",
      "of a policeman's trousers lying cheek by jowl with Queen Alexandra's\n",
      "wedding veil--but has contrived that the whole assortment shall be\n",
      "lightly stitched together by a single thread. Memory is the seamstress,\n",
      "and a capricious one at that. Memory runs her needle in and out, up and\n",
      "down, hither and thither. We know not what comes next, or what follows\n",
      "after. Thus, the most ordinary movement in the world, such as sitting\n",
      "down at a table and pulling the inkstand towards one, may agitate a\n",
      "thousand odd, disconnected fragments, now bright, now dim, hanging and\n",
      "bobbing and dipping and flaunting, like the underlinen of a family of\n",
      "fourteen on a line in a gale of wind. Instead of being a single,\n",
      "downright, bluff piece of work of which no man need feel ashamed, our\n",
      "commonest deeds are set about with a fluttering and flickering of wings,\n",
      "a rising and falling of lights. Thus it was that Orlando, dipping his pen\n",
      "in the ink, saw the mocking face of the lost Princess and asked himself a\n",
      "million questions instantly which were as arrows dipped in gall. Where\n",
      "was she; and why had she left him? Was the Ambassador her uncle or her\n",
      "lover? Had they plotted? Was she forced? Was she married? Was she\n",
      "dead?--all of which so drove their venom into him that, as if to vent his\n",
      "agony somewhere, he plunged his quill so deep into the inkhorn that the\n",
      "ink spirted over the table, which act, explain it how one may (and no\n",
      "explanation perhaps is possible--Memory is inexplicable), at once\n",
      "substituted for the face of the Princess a face of a very different sort.\n",
      "But whose was it, he asked himself? And he had to wait, perhaps half a\n",
      "minute, looking at the new picture which lay on top of the old, as one\n",
      "lantern slide is half seen through the next, before he could say to\n",
      "himself, 'This is the face of that rather fat, shabby man who sat in\n",
      "Twitchett's room ever so many years ago when old Queen Bess came here to\n",
      "dine; and I saw him,' Orlando continued, catching at another of those\n",
      "little coloured rags, 'sitting at the table, as I peeped in on my way\n",
      "downstairs, and he had the most amazing eyes,' said Orlando, 'that ever\n",
      "were, but who the devil was he?' Orlando asked, for here Memory added to\n",
      "the forehead and eyes, first, a coarse, grease-stained ruffle, then a\n",
      "brown doublet, and finally a pair of thick boots such as citizens wear in\n",
      "Cheapside. 'Not a Nobleman; not one of us,' said Orlando (which he would\n",
      "not have said aloud, for he was the most courteous of gentlemen; but it\n",
      "shows what an effect noble birth has upon the mind and incidentally how\n",
      "difficult it is for a nobleman to be a writer), 'a poet, I dare say.' By\n",
      "all the laws, Memory, having disturbed him sufficiently, should now have\n",
      "blotted the whole thing out completely, or have fetched up something so\n",
      "idiotic and out of keeping--like a dog chasing a cat or an old woman\n",
      "blowing her nose into a red cotton handkerchief--that, in despair of\n",
      "keeping pace with her vagaries, Orlando should have struck his pen in\n",
      "earnest against his paper. (For we can, if we have the resolution, turn\n",
      "the hussy, Memory, and all her ragtag and bobtail out of the house.) But\n",
      "Orlando paused. Memory still held before him the image of a shabby man\n",
      "with big, bright eyes. Still he looked, still he paused. It is these\n",
      "pauses that are our undoing. It is then that sedition enters the fortress\n",
      "and our troops rise in insurrection. Once before he had paused, and love\n",
      "with its horrid rout, its shawms, its cymbals, and its heads with gory\n",
      "locks torn from the shoulders had burst in. From love he had suffered the\n",
      "tortures of the damned. Now, again, he paused, and into the breach thus\n",
      "made, leapt Ambition, the harridan, and Poetry, the witch, and Desire of\n",
      "Fame, the strumpet; all joined hands and made of his heart their dancing\n",
      "ground. Standing upright in the solitude of his room, he vowed that he\n",
      "would be the first poet of his race and bring immortal lustre upon his\n",
      "name. He said (reciting the names and exploits of his ancestors) that Sir\n",
      "Boris had fought and killed the Paynim; Sir Gawain, the Turk; Sir Miles,\n",
      "the Pole; Sir Andrew, the Frank; Sir Richard, the Austrian; Sir Jordan,\n",
      "the Frenchman; and Sir Herbert, the Spaniard. But of all that killing and\n",
      "campaigning, that drinking and love-making, that spending and hunting and\n",
      "riding and eating, what remained? A skull; a finger. Whereas, he said,\n",
      "turning to the page of Sir Thomas Browne, which lay open upon the\n",
      "table--and again he paused. Like an incantation rising from all parts of\n",
      "the room, from the night wind and the moonlight, rolled the divine melody\n",
      "of those words which, lest they should outstare this page, we will leave\n",
      "where they lie entombed, not dead, embalmed rather, so fresh is their\n",
      "colour, so sound their breathing--and Orlando, comparing that achievement\n",
      "with those of his ancestors, cried out that they and their deeds were\n",
      "dust and ashes, but this man and his words were immortal.\n",
      "\n",
      "He soon perceived, however, that the battles which Sir Miles and the rest\n",
      "had waged against armed knights to win a kingdom, were not half so\n",
      "arduous as this which he now undertook to win immortality against the\n",
      "English language. Anyone moderately familiar with the rigours of\n",
      "composition will not need to be told the story in detail; how he wrote\n",
      "and it seemed good; read and it seemed vile; corrected and tore up; cut\n",
      "out; put in; was in ecstasy; in despair; had his good nights and bad\n",
      "mornings; snatched at ideas and lost them; saw his book plain before him\n",
      "and it vanished; acted his people's parts as he ate; mouthed them as he\n",
      "walked; now cried; now laughed; vacillated between this style and that;\n",
      "now preferred the heroic and pompous; next the plain and simple; now the\n",
      "vales of Tempe; then the fields of Kent or Cornwall; and could not decide\n",
      "whether he was the divinest genius or the greatest fool in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was to settle this last question that he decided after many months of\n",
      "such feverish labour, to break the solitude of years and communicate with\n",
      "the outer world. He had a friend in London, one Giles Isham, of Norfolk,\n",
      "who, though of gentle birth, was acquainted with writers and could\n",
      "doubtless put him in touch with some member of that blessed, indeed\n",
      "sacred, fraternity. For, to Orlando in the state he was now in, there was\n",
      "a glory about a man who had written a book and had it printed, which\n",
      "outshone all the glories of blood and state. To his imagination it seemed\n",
      "as if even the bodies of those instinct with such divine thoughts must be\n",
      "transfigured. They must have aureoles for hair, incense for breath, and\n",
      "roses must grow between their lips--which was certainly not true either\n",
      "of himself or Mr Dupper. He could think of no greater happiness than to\n",
      "be allowed to sit behind a curtain and hear them talk. Even the\n",
      "imagination of that bold and various discourse made the memory of what he\n",
      "and his courtier friends used to talk about--a dog, a horse, a woman, a\n",
      "game of cards--seem brutish in the extreme. He bethought him with pride\n",
      "that he had always been called a scholar, and sneered at for his love of\n",
      "solitude and books. He had never been apt at pretty phrases. He would\n",
      "stand stock still, blush, and stride like a grenadier in a ladies'\n",
      "drawing-room. He had twice fallen, in sheer abstraction, from his horse.\n",
      "He had broken Lady Winchilsea's fan once while making a rhyme. Eagerly\n",
      "recalling these and other instances of his unfitness for the life of\n",
      "society, an ineffable hope, that all the turbulence of his youth, his\n",
      "clumsiness, his blushes, his long walks, and his love of the country\n",
      "proved that he himself belonged to the sacred race rather than to the\n",
      "noble--was by birth a writer, rather than an aristocrat--possessed him.\n",
      "For the first time since the night of the great flood he was happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He now commissioned Mr Isham of Norfolk to deliver to Mr Nicholas Greene\n",
      "of Clifford's Inn a document which set forth Orlando's admiration for his\n",
      "works (for Nick Greene was a very famous writer at that time) and his\n",
      "desire to make his acquaintance; which he scarcely dared ask; for he had\n",
      "nothing to offer in return; but if Mr Nicholas Greene would condescend to\n",
      "visit him, a coach and four would be at the corner of Fetter Lane at\n",
      "whatever hour Mr Greene chose to appoint, and bring him safely to\n",
      "Orlando's house. One may fill up the phrases which then followed; and\n",
      "figure Orlando's delight when, in no long time, Mr Greene signified his\n",
      "acceptance of the Noble Lord's invitation; took his place in the coach\n",
      "and was set down in the hall to the south of the main building punctually\n",
      "at seven o'clock on Monday, April the twenty-first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many Kings, Queens, and Ambassadors had been received there; Judges had\n",
      "stood there in their ermine. The loveliest ladies of the land had come\n",
      "there; and the sternest warriors. Banners hung there which had been at\n",
      "Flodden and at Agincourt. There were displayed the painted coats of arms\n",
      "with their lions and their leopards and their coronets. There were the\n",
      "long tables where the gold and silver plate was stood; and there the vast\n",
      "fireplaces of wrought Italian marble where nightly a whole oak tree, with\n",
      "its million leaves and its nests of rook and wren, was burnt to ashes.\n",
      "Nicholas Greene, the poet stood there now, plainly dressed in his\n",
      "slouched hat and black doublet, carrying in one hand a small bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "That Orlando as he hastened to greet him was slightly disappointed was\n",
      "inevitable. The poet was not above middle height; was of a mean figure;\n",
      "was lean and stooped somewhat, and, stumbling over the mastiff on\n",
      "entering, the dog bit him. Moreover, Orlando for all his knowledge of\n",
      "mankind was puzzled where to place him. There was something about him\n",
      "which belonged neither to servant, squire, or noble. The head with its\n",
      "rounded forehead and beaked nose was fine, but the chin receded. The eyes\n",
      "were brilliant, but the lips hung loose and slobbered. It was the\n",
      "expression of the face--as a whole, however, that was disquieting. There\n",
      "was none of that stately composure which makes the faces of the nobility\n",
      "so pleasing to look at; nor had it anything of the dignified servility of\n",
      "a well-trained domestic's face; it was a face seamed, puckered, and drawn\n",
      "together. Poet though he was, it seemed as if he were more used to scold\n",
      "than to flatter; to quarrel than to coo; to scramble than to ride; to\n",
      "struggle than to rest; to hate than to love. This, too, was shown by the\n",
      "quickness of his movements; and by something fiery and suspicious in his\n",
      "glance. Orlando was somewhat taken aback. But they went to dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, Orlando, who usually took such things for granted, was, for the\n",
      "first time, unaccountably ashamed of the number of his servants and of\n",
      "the splendour of his table. Stranger still, he bethought him with\n",
      "pride--for the thought was generally distasteful--of that great\n",
      "grandmother Moll who had milked the cows. He was about somehow to allude\n",
      "to this humble woman and her milk-pails, when the poet forestalled him by\n",
      "saying that it was odd, seeing how common the name of Greene was, that\n",
      "the family had come over with the Conqueror and was of the highest\n",
      "nobility in France. Unfortunately, they had come down in the world and\n",
      "done little more than leave their name to the royal borough of Greenwich.\n",
      "Further talk of the same sort, about lost castles, coats of arms, cousins\n",
      "who were baronets in the north, intermarriage with noble families in the\n",
      "west, how some Greens spelt the name with an e at the end, and others\n",
      "without, lasted till the venison was on the table. Then Orlando contrived\n",
      "to say something of Grandmother Moll and her cows, and had eased his\n",
      "heart a little of its burden by the time the wild fowl were before them.\n",
      "But it was not until the Malmsey was passing freely that Orlando dared\n",
      "mention what he could not help thinking a more important matter than the\n",
      "Greens or the cows; that is to say the sacred subject of poetry. At the\n",
      "first mention of the word, the poet's eyes flashed fire; he dropped the\n",
      "fine gentleman airs he had worn; thumped his glass on the table, and\n",
      "launched into one of the longest, most intricate, most passionate, and\n",
      "bitterest stories that Orlando had ever heard, save from the lips of a\n",
      "jilted woman, about a play of his; another poet; and a critic. Of the\n",
      "nature of poetry itself, Orlando only gathered that it was harder to sell\n",
      "than prose, and though the lines were shorter took longer in the writing.\n",
      "So the talk went on with ramifications interminable, until Orlando\n",
      "ventured to hint that he had himself been so rash as to write--but here\n",
      "the poet leapt from his chair. A mouse had squeaked in the wainscot, he\n",
      "said. The truth was, he explained, that his nerves were in a state where\n",
      "a mouse's squeak upset them for a fortnight. Doubtless the house was full\n",
      "of vermin, but Orlando had not heard them. The poet then gave Orlando the\n",
      "full story of his health for the past ten years or so. It had been so bad\n",
      "that one could only marvel that he still lived. He had had the palsy, the\n",
      "gout, the ague, the dropsy, and the three sorts of fever in succession;\n",
      "added to which he had an enlarged heart, a great spleen, and a diseased\n",
      "liver. But, above all, he had, he told Orlando, sensations in his spine\n",
      "which defied description. There was one knob about the third from the top\n",
      "which burnt like fire; another about second from the bottom which was\n",
      "cold as ice. Sometimes he woke with a brain like lead; at others it was\n",
      "as if a thousand wax tapers were alight and people were throwing\n",
      "fireworks inside him. He could feel a rose leaf through his mattress, he\n",
      "said; and knew his way almost about London by the feel of the cobbles.\n",
      "Altogether he was a piece of machinery so finely made and curiously put\n",
      "together (here he raised his hand as if unconsciously, and indeed it was\n",
      "of the finest shape imaginable) that it confounded him to think that he\n",
      "had only sold five hundred copies of his poem, but that of course was\n",
      "largely due to the conspiracy against him. All he could say, he\n",
      "concluded, banging his fist upon the table, was that the art of poetry\n",
      "was dead in England.\n",
      "\n",
      "How that could be with Shakespeare, Marlowe, Ben Jonson, Browne, Donne,\n",
      "all now writing or just having written, Orlando, reeling off the names of\n",
      "his favourite heroes, could not think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greene laughed sardonically. Shakespeare, he admitted, had written some\n",
      "scenes that were well enough; but he had taken them chiefly from Marlowe.\n",
      "Marlowe was a likely boy, but what could you say of a lad who died before\n",
      "he was thirty? As for Browne, he was for writing poetry in prose, and\n",
      "people soon got tired of such conceits as that. Donne was a mountebank\n",
      "who wrapped up his lack of meaning in hard words. The gulls were taken\n",
      "in; but the style would be out of fashion twelve months hence. As for Ben\n",
      "Jonson--Ben Jonson was a friend of his and he never spoke ill of his\n",
      "friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, he concluded, the great age of literature is past; the great age of\n",
      "literature was the Greek; the Elizabethan age was inferior in every\n",
      "respect to the Greek. In such ages men cherished a divine ambition which\n",
      "he might call La Gloire (he pronounced it Glawr, so that Orlando did not\n",
      "at first catch his meaning). Now all young writers were in the pay of the\n",
      "booksellers and poured out any trash that would sell. Shakespeare was the\n",
      "chief offender in this way and Shakespeare was already paying the\n",
      "penalty. Their own age, he said, was marked by precious conceits and wild\n",
      "experiments--neither of which the Greeks would have tolerated for a\n",
      "moment. Much though it hurt him to say it--for he loved literature as he\n",
      "loved his life--he could see no good in the present and had no hope for\n",
      "the future. Here he poured himself out another glass of wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Orlando was shocked by these doctrines; yet could not help observing that\n",
      "the critic himself seemed by no means downcast. On the contrary, the more\n",
      "he denounced his own time, the more complacent he became. He could\n",
      "remember, he said, a night at the Cock Tavern in Fleet Street when Kit\n",
      "Marlowe was there and some others. Kit was in high feather, rather drunk,\n",
      "which he easily became, and in a mood to say silly things. He could see\n",
      "him now, brandishing his glass at the company and hiccoughing out, 'Stap\n",
      "my vitals, Bill' (this was to Shakespeare), 'there's a great wave coming\n",
      "and you're on the top of it,' by which he meant, Greene explained, that\n",
      "they were trembling on the verge of a great age in English literature,\n",
      "and that Shakespeare was to be a poet of some importance. Happily for\n",
      "himself, he was killed two nights later in a drunken brawl, and so did\n",
      "not live to see how this prediction turned out. 'Poor foolish fellow,'\n",
      "said Greene, 'to go and say a thing like that. A great age, forsooth--the\n",
      "Elizabethan a great age!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'So, my dear Lord,' he continued, settling himself comfortably in his\n",
      "chair and rubbing the wine-glass between his fingers, 'we must make the\n",
      "best of it, cherish the past and honour those writers--there are still a\n",
      "few of 'em--who take antiquity for their model and write, not for pay but\n",
      "for Glawr.' (Orlando could have wished him a better accent.) 'Glawr',\n",
      "said Greene, 'is the spur of noble minds. Had I a pension of three\n",
      "hundred pounds a year paid quarterly, I would live for Glawr alone. I\n",
      "would lie in bed every morning reading Cicero. I would imitate his style\n",
      "so that you couldn't tell the difference between us. That's what I call\n",
      "fine writing,' said Greene; 'that's what I call Glawr. But it's necessary\n",
      "to have a pension to do it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Orlando had abandoned all hope of discussing his own work\n",
      "with the poet; but this mattered the less as the talk now got upon the\n",
      "lives and characters of Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and the rest, all of\n",
      "whom Greene had known intimately and about whom he had a thousand\n",
      "anecdotes of the most amusing kind to tell. Orlando had never laughed so\n",
      "much in his life. These, then, were his gods! Half were drunken and all\n",
      "were amorous. Most of them quarrelled with their wives; not one of them\n",
      "was above a lie or an intrigue of the most paltry kind. Their poetry was\n",
      "scribbled down on the backs of washing bills held to the heads of\n",
      "printer's devils at the street door. Thus Hamlet went to press; thus\n",
      "Lear; thus Othello. No wonder, as Greene said, that these plays show the\n",
      "faults they do. The rest of the time was spent in carousings and\n",
      "junketings in taverns and in beer gardens, When things were said that\n",
      "passed belief for wit, and things were done that made the utmost frolic\n",
      "of the courtiers seem pale in comparison. All this Greene told with a\n",
      "spirit that roused Orlando to the highest pitch of delight. He had a\n",
      "power of mimicry that brought the dead to life, and could say the finest\n",
      "things of books provided they were written three hundred years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "So time passed, and Orlando felt for his guest a strange mixture of\n",
      "liking and contempt, of admiration and pity, as well as something too\n",
      "indefinite to be called by any one name, but had something of fear in it\n",
      "and something of fascination. He talked incessantly about himself, yet\n",
      "was such good company that one could listen to the story of his ague for\n",
      "ever. Then he was so witty; then he was so irreverent; then he made so\n",
      "free with the names of God and Woman; then he was So full of queer crafts\n",
      "and had such strange lore in his head; could make salad in three hundred\n",
      "different ways; knew all that could be known of the mixing of wines;\n",
      "played half-a-dozen musical instruments, and was the first person, and\n",
      "perhaps the last, to toast cheese in the great Italian fireplace. That he\n",
      "did not know a geranium from a carnation, an oak from a birch tree, a\n",
      "mastiff from a greyhound, a teg from a ewe, wheat from barley, plough\n",
      "land from fallow; was ignorant of the rotation of the crops; thought\n",
      "oranges grew underground and turnips on trees; preferred any townscape to\n",
      "any landscape;--all this and much more amazed Orlando, who had never met\n",
      "anybody of his kind before. Even the maids, who despised him, tittered at\n",
      "his jokes, and the men-servants, who loathed him, hung about to hear his\n",
      "stories. Indeed, the house had never been so lively as now that he was\n",
      "there--all of which gave Orlando a great deal to think about, and caused\n",
      "him to compare this way of life with the old. He recalled the sort of\n",
      "talk he had been used to about the King of Spain's apoplexy or the mating\n",
      "of a bitch; he bethought him how the day passed between the stables and\n",
      "the dressing closet; he remembered how the Lords snored over their wine\n",
      "and hated anybody who woke them up. He bethought him how active and\n",
      "valiant they were in body; how slothful and timid in mind. Worried by\n",
      "these thoughts, and unable to strike a proper balance, he came to the\n",
      "conclusion that he had admitted to his house a plaguey spirit of unrest\n",
      "that would never suffer him to sleep sound again.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same moment, Nick Greene came to precisely the opposite\n",
      "conclusion. Lying in bed of a morning on the softest pillows between the\n",
      "smoothest sheets and looking out of his oriel window upon turf which for\n",
      "centuries had known neither dandelion nor dock weed, he thought that\n",
      "unless he could somehow make his escape, he should be smothered alive.\n",
      "Getting up and hearing the pigeons coo, dressing and hearing the\n",
      "fountains fall, he thought that unless he could hear the drays roar upon\n",
      "the cobbles of Fleet Street, he would never write another line. If this\n",
      "goes on much longer, he thought, hearing the footman mend the fire and\n",
      "spread the table with silver dishes next door, I shall fall asleep and\n",
      "(here he gave a prodigious yawn) sleeping die.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he sought Orlando in his room, and explained that he had not been able\n",
      "to sleep a wink all night because of the silence. (Indeed, the house was\n",
      "surrounded by a park fifteen miles in circumference and a wall ten feet\n",
      "high.) Silence, he said, was of all things the most oppressive to his\n",
      "nerves. He would end his visit, by Orlando's leave, that very morning.\n",
      "Orlando felt some relief at this, yet also a great reluctance to let him\n",
      "go. The house, he thought, would seem very dull without him. On parting\n",
      "(for he had never yet liked to mention the subject), he had the temerity\n",
      "to press his play upon the Death of Hercules upon the poet and ask his\n",
      "opinion of it. The poet took it; muttered something about Glawr and\n",
      "Cicero, which Orlando cut short by promising to pay the pension\n",
      "quarterly; whereupon Greene, with many protestations of affection, jumped\n",
      "into the coach and was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great hall had never seemed so large, so splendid, or so empty as the\n",
      "chariot rolled away. Orlando knew that he would never have the heart to\n",
      "make toasted cheese in the Italian fireplace again. He would never have\n",
      "the wit to crack jokes about Italian pictures; never have the skill to\n",
      "mix punch as it should be mixed; a thousand good quips and cranks would\n",
      "be lost to him. Yet what a relief to be out of the sound of that\n",
      "querulous voice, what a luxury to be alone once more, so he could not\n",
      "help reflecting, as he unloosed the mastiff which had been tied up these\n",
      "six weeks because it never saw the poet without biting him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nick Greene was set down at the corner of Fetter Lane that same\n",
      "afternoon, and found things going on much as he had left them. Mrs\n",
      "Greene, that is to say, was giving birth to a baby in one room; Tom\n",
      "Fletcher was drinking gin in another. Books were tumbled all about the\n",
      "floor; dinner--such as it was--was set on a dressing-table where the\n",
      "children had been making mud pies. But this, Greene felt, was the\n",
      "atmosphere for writing, here he could write, and write he did. The\n",
      "subject was made for him. A noble Lord at home. A visit to a Nobleman in\n",
      "the country--his new poem was to have some such title as that. Seizing\n",
      "the pen with which his little boy was tickling the cat's ears, and\n",
      "dipping it in the egg-cup which served for inkpot, Greene dashed off a\n",
      "very spirited satire there and then. It was so done to a turn that no one\n",
      "could doubt that the young Lord who was roasted was Orlando; his most\n",
      "private sayings and doings, his enthusiasms and folies, down to the very\n",
      "colour of his hair and the foreign way he had of rolling his r's, were\n",
      "there to the life. And if there had been any doubt about it, Greene\n",
      "clinched the matter by introducing, with scarcely any disguise, passages\n",
      "from that aristocratic tragedy, the Death of Hercules, which he found as\n",
      "he expected, wordy and bombastic in the extreme.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pamphlet, which ran at once into several editions, and paid the\n",
      "expenses of Mrs Greene's tenth lying-in, was soon sent by friends who\n",
      "take care of such matters to Orlando himself. When he had read it, which\n",
      "he did with deadly composure from start to finish, he rang for the\n",
      "footman; delivered the document to him at the end of a pair of tongs;\n",
      "bade him drop it in the filthiest heart of the foulest midden on the\n",
      "estate. Then, when the man was turning to go he stopped him, 'Take the\n",
      "swiftest horse in the stable,' he said, 'ride for dear life to Harwich.\n",
      "There embark upon a ship which you will find bound for Norway. Buy for me\n",
      "from the King's own kennels the finest elk-hounds of the Royal strain,\n",
      "male and female. Bring them back without delay. For', he murmured,\n",
      "scarcely above his breath as he turned to his books, 'I have done with\n",
      "men.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The footman, who was perfectly trained in his duties, bowed and\n",
      "disappeared. He fulfilled his task so efficiently that he was back that\n",
      "day three weeks, leading in his hand a leash of the finest elk-hounds,\n",
      "one of whom, a female, gave birth that very night under the dinner-table\n",
      "to a litter of eight fine puppies. Orlando had them brought to his\n",
      "bedchamber.\n",
      "\n",
      "'For', he said, 'I have done with men.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, he paid the pension quarterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, at the age of thirty, or thereabouts, this young Nobleman had not\n",
      "only had every experience that life has to offer, but had seen the\n",
      "worthlessness of them all. Love and ambition, women and poets were all\n",
      "equally vain. Literature was a farce. The night after reading Greene's\n",
      "Visit to a Nobleman in the Country, he burnt in a great conflagration\n",
      "fifty-seven poetical works, only retaining 'The Oak Tree', which was his\n",
      "boyish dream and very short. Two things alone remained to him in which he\n",
      "now put any trust: dogs and nature; an elk-hound and a rose bush. The\n",
      "world, in all its variety, life in all its complexity, had shrunk to\n",
      "that. Dogs and a bush were the whole of it. So feeling quit of a vast\n",
      "mountain of illusion, and very naked in consequence, he called his hounds\n",
      "to him and strode through the Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "So long had he been secluded, writing and reading, that he had half\n",

      "reached that high mound whence on fine days half of England with a slice\n",
      "of Wales and Scotland thrown in can be seen, he flung himself under his\n",
      "favourite oak tree and felt that if he need never speak to another man or\n",
      "woman so long as he lived; if his dogs did not develop the faculty of\n",
      "speech; if he never met a poet or a Princess again, he might make out\n",

      "\n",
      "Here he came then, day after day, week after week, month after month,\n",
      "year after year. He saw the beech trees turn golden and the young ferns\n",
      "unfurl; he saw the moon sickle and then circular; he saw--but probably\n",
      "the reader can imagine the passage which should follow and how every tree\n",

      "woman can sweep up in half an hour; a conclusion which, one cannot help\n",
      "feeling, might have been reached more quickly by the simple statement\n",
      "that 'Time passed' (here the exact amount could be indicated in brackets)\n",
      "and nothing whatever happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Time, unfortunately, though it makes animals and vegetables bloom and\n",
      "fade with amazing punctuality, has no such simple effect upon the mind of\n",
      "man. The mind of man, moreover, works with equal strangeness upon the\n",
      "body of time. An hour, once it lodges in the queer element of the human\n",
      "spirit, may be stretched to fifty or a hundred times its clock length; on\n",
      "the other hand, an hour may be accurately represented on the timepiece of\n",
      "the mind by one second. This extraordinary discrepancy between time on\n",
      "the clock and time in the mind is less known than it should be and\n",
      "deserves fuller investigation. But the biographer, whose interests are,\n",
      "as we have said, highly restricted, must confine himself to one simple\n",
      "statement: when a man has reached the age of thirty, as Orlando now had,\n",
      "time when he is thinking becomes inordinately long; time when he is doing\n",
      "becomes inordinately short. Thus Orlando gave his orders and did the\n",
      "business of his vast estates in a flash; but directly he was alone on the\n",
      "mound under the oak tree, the seconds began to round and fill until it\n",
      "seemed as if they would never fall. They filled themselves, moreover,\n",
      "with the strangest variety of objects. For not only did he find himself\n",
      "confronted by problems which have puzzled the wisest of men, such as What\n",
      "is love? What friendship? What truth? but directly he came to think about\n",
      "them, his whole past, which seemed to him of extreme length and variety,\n",
      "rushed into the falling second, swelled it a dozen times its natural\n",
      "size, coloured it a thousand tints, and filled it with all the odds and\n",
      "ends in the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In such thinking (or by whatever name it should be called) he spent\n",
      "months and years of his life. It would be no exaggeration to say that he\n",
      "would go out after breakfast a man of thirty and come home to dinner a\n",
      "man of fifty-five at least. Some weeks added a century to his age, others\n",
      "no more than three seconds at most. Altogether, the task of estimating\n",
      "the length of human life (of the animals' we presume not to speak) is\n",
      "beyond our capacity, for directly we say that it is ages long, we are\n",
      "reminded that it is briefer than the fall of a rose leaf to the ground.\n",
      "Of the two forces which alternately, and what is more confusing still, at\n",
      "the same moment, dominate our unfortunate numbskulls--brevity and\n",
      "diuturnity--Orlando was sometimes under the influence of the\n",
      "elephant-footed deity, then of the gnat-winged fly. Life seemed to him of\n",
      "prodigious length. Yet even so, it went like a flash. But even when it\n",
      "stretched longest and the moments swelled biggest and he seemed to wander\n",
      "alone in deserts of vast eternity, there was no time for the smoothing\n",
      "out and deciphering of those scored parchments which thirty years among\n",
      "men and women had rolled tight in his heart and brain. Long before he had\n",
      "done thinking about Love (the oak tree had put forth its leaves and\n",
      "shaken them to the ground a dozen times in the process) Ambition would\n",
      "jostle it off the field, to be replaced by Friendship or Literature. And\n",
      "as the first question had not been settled--What is Love?--back it would\n",
      "come at the least provocation or none, and hustle Books or Metaphors of\n",
      "What one lives for into the margin, there to wait till they saw their\n",
      "chance to rush into the field again. What made the process still longer\n",
      "was that it was profusely illustrated, not only with pictures, as that of\n",
      "old Queen Elizabeth, laid on her tapestry couch in rose-coloured brocade\n",
      "with an ivory snuff-box in her hand and a gold-hilted sword by her side,\n",
      "but with scents--she was strongly perfumed--and with sounds; the stags\n",
      "were barking in Richmond Park that winter's day. And so, the thought of\n",
      "love would be all ambered over with snow and winter; with log fires\n",
      "burning; with Russian women, gold swords, and the bark of stags; with old\n",
      "King James' slobbering and fireworks and sacks of treasure in the holds\n",
      "of Elizabethan sailing ships. Every single thing, once he tried to\n",
      "dislodge it from its place in his mind, he found thus cumbered with other\n",
      "matter like the lump of glass which, after a year at the bottom of the\n",
      "sea, is grown about with bones and dragon-flies, and coins and the\n",
      "tresses of drowned women.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Another metaphor by Jupiter!' he would exclaim as he said this (which\n",
      "will show the disorderly and circuitous way in which his mind worked and\n",
      "explain why the oak tree flowered and faded so often before he came to\n",
      "any conclusion about Love). 'And what's the point of it?' he would ask\n",
      "himself. 'Why not say simply in so many words--' and then he would try to\n",

      "simply in so many words what love is. 'A figure like that is manifestly\n",

      "distance, he could not help reverencing. 'The sky is blue,' he said, 'the\n",
      "grass is green.' Looking up, he saw that, on the contrary, the sky is\n",
      "like the veils which a thousand Madonnas have let fall from their hair;\n",
      "and the grass fleets and darkens like a flight of girls fleeing the\n",
      "embraces of hairy satyrs from enchanted woods. 'Upon my word,' he said\n",
      "(for he had fallen into the bad habit of speaking aloud), 'I don't see\n",
      "that one's more true than another. Both are utterly false.' And he\n",
      "despaired of being able to solve the problem of what poetry is and what\n",

      "healthy body, witness cheeks and limbs--a man who never thought twice\n",
      "about heading a charge or fighting a duel--should be so subject to the\n",
      "lethargy of thought, and rendered so susceptible by it, that when it came\n",
      "to a question of poetry, or his own competence in it, he was as shy as a\n",
      "little girl behind her mother's cottage door. In our belief, Greene's\n",

      "as if that sardonic loose-lipped man, treacherous as he had proved\n",
      "himself, were the Muse in person, and it was to him that Orlando must do\n",
      "homage. So Orlando, that summer morning, offered him a variety of\n",
      "phrases, some plain, others figured, and Nick Greene kept shaking his\n",
      "head and sneering and muttering something about Glawr and Cicero and the\n",
      "death of poetry in our time. At length, starting to his feet (it was now\n",
      "winter and very cold) Orlando swore one of the most remarkable oaths of\n",
      "his lifetime, for it bound him to a servitude than which none is\n",
      "stricter. 'I'll be blasted', he said, 'if I ever write another word, or\n",
      "try to write another word, to please Nick Greene or the Muse. Bad, good,\n",
      "or indifferent, I'll write, from this day forward, to please myself'; and\n",
      "here he made as if he were tearing a whole budget of papers across and\n",
      "tossing them in the face of that sneering loose-lipped man. Upon which,\n",
      "as a cur ducks if you stoop to shy a stone at him, Memory ducked her\n",

      "whatever.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Orlando, all the same, went on thinking. He had indeed much to think\n",
      "of. For when he tore the parchment across, he tore, in one rending, the\n",
      "scrolloping, emblazoned scroll which he had made out in his own favour in\n",
      "the solitude of his room appointing himself, as the King appoints\n",
      "Ambassadors, the first poet of his race, the first writer of his age,\n",
      "conferring eternal immortality upon his soul and granting his body a\n",
      "grave among laurels and the intangible banners of a people's reverence\n",
      "perpetually. Eloquent as this all was, he now tore it up and threw it in\n",
      "the dustbin. 'Fame', he said. 'is like' (and since there was no Nick\n",
      "Greene to stop him, he went on to revel in images of which we will choose\n",
      "only one or two of the quietest) 'a braided coat which hampers the limbs;\n",
      "a jacket of silver which curbs the heart; a painted shield which covers a\n",
      "scarecrow,' etc. etc. The pith of his phrases was that while fame impedes\n",
      "and constricts, obscurity wraps about a man like a mist; obscurity is\n",
      "dark, ample, and free; obscurity lets the mind take its way unimpeded.\n",
      "Over the obscure man is poured the merciful suffusion of darkness. None\n",
      "knows where he goes or comes. He may seek the truth and speak it; he\n",
      "alone is free; he alone is truthful; he alone is at peace. And so he sank\n",
      "into a quiet mood, under the oak tree, the hardness of whose roots,\n",
      "exposed above the ground, seemed to him rather comfortable than\n",
      "otherwise.\n",

      "out), for, he thought, Shakespeare must have written like that, and the\n",
      "church builders built like that, anonymously, needing no thanking or\n",
      "naming, but only their work in the daytime and a little ale perhaps at\n",
      "night--'What an admirable life this is,' he thought, stretching his limbs\n",
      "out under the oak tree. 'And why not enjoy it this very moment?' The\n",
      "thought struck him like a bullet. Ambition dropped like a plummet. Rid of\n",
      "the heart-burn of rejected love, and of vanity rebuked, and all the other\n",

      "wished or that, but circumspectly, by a single architect with one idea in\n",
      "his head. Courts and buildings, grey, red, plum colour, lay orderly and\n",
      "symmetrical; the courts were some of them oblong and some square; in this\n",

      "some pointed; here was a chapel, there a belfry; spaces of the greenest\n",
      "grass lay in between and clumps of cedar trees and beds of bright\n",
      "flowers; all were clasped--yet so well set out was it that it seemed that\n",
      "every part had room to spread itself fittingly--by the roll of a massive\n",
      "wall; while smoke from innumerable chimneys curled perpetually into the\n",
      "air. This vast, yet ordered building, which could house a thousand men\n",
      "and perhaps two thousand horses, was built, Orlando thought, by workmen\n",
      "whose names are unknown. Here have lived, for more centuries than I can\n",
      "count, the obscure generations of my own obscure family. Not one of these\n",

      "it is for the historian of letters to remark that he had changed his\n",
      "style amazingly. His floridity was chastened; his abundance curbed; the\n",
      "age of prose was congealing those warm fountains. The very landscape\n",
      "outside was less stuck about with garlands and the briars themselves were\n",

      "apparition appeared again; and on Wednesday noon appeared once more. This\n",
      "time, Orlando was determined to follow her, nor apparently was she afraid\n",
      "to be found, for she slackened her steps as he came up and looked him\n",
      "full in the face. Any other woman thus caught in a Lord's private grounds\n",
      "would have been afraid; any other woman with that face, head-dress, and\n",
      "aspect would have thrown her mantilla across her shoulders to hide it.\n",
      "For this lady resembled nothing so much as a hare; a hare startled, but\n",

      "audacity; a hare that sits upright and glowers at its pursuer with great,\n",
      "bulging eyes; with ears erect but quivering, with nose pointed, but\n",
      "twitching. This hare, moreover, was six feet high and wore a head-dress\n",
      "into the bargain of some antiquated kind which made her look still\n",
      "taller. Thus confronted, she stared at Orlando with a stare in which\n",
      "timidity and audacity were most strangely combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, she asked him, with a proper, but somewhat clumsy curtsey, to\n",
      "forgive her her intrusion. Then, rising to her full height again, which\n",

      "but seldom went to bed sober. Here she tee-heed and haw-hawed again. In\n",

      "When the Archduchess Harriet Griselda stooped to fasten the buckle,\n",
      "Orlando heard, suddenly and unaccountably, far off the beating of Love's\n",
      "wings. The distant stir of that soft plumage roused in him a thousand\n",
      "memories of rushing waters, of loveliness in the snow and faithlessness\n",
      "in the flood; and the sound came nearer; and he blushed and trembled; and\n",
      "he was moved as he had thought never to be moved again; and he was ready\n",
      "to raise his hands and let the bird of beauty alight upon his shoulders,\n",
      "when--horror!--a creaking sound like that the crows make tumbling over\n",
      "the trees began to reverberate; the air seemed dark with coarse black\n",
      "wings; voices croaked; bits of straw, twigs, and feathers dropped; and\n",
      "there pitched down upon his shoulders the heaviest and foulest of the\n",
      "birds; which is the vulture. Thus he rushed from the room and sent the\n",
      "footman to see the Archduchess Harriet to her carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Love, to which we may now return, has two faces; one white, the other\n",
      "black; two bodies; one smooth, the other hairy. It has two hands, two\n",
      "feet, two nails, two, indeed, of every member and each one is the exact\n",
      "opposite of the other. Yet, so strictly are they joined together that you\n",
      "cannot separate them. In this case, Orlando's love began her flight\n",
      "towards him with her white face turned, and her smooth and lovely body\n",
      "outwards. Nearer and nearer she came wafting before her airs of pure\n",
      "delight. All of a sudden (at the sight of the Archduchess presumably) she\n",

      "every day and night by phantoms of the foulest kind. Vainly, it seemed,\n",
      "had he furnished his house with silver and hung the walls with arras,\n",
      "when at any moment a dung-bedraggled fowl could settle upon his writing\n",

      "waddling ungracefully across the galleries. Now, she perched, top heavy\n",
      "upon a fire screen. When he chased her out, back she came and pecked at\n",
      "the glass till she broke it.\n",
