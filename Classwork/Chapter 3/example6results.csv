0,Ashes,"Right
Hate, hate, hate!
Bring it!

You don't understand me
And you probably never will
I got a tendency to self-destruct
And a soft spot for the filth
A hair-trigger temperament
A switchblade for a tongue
I'm a walking one-man genocide
With a black belt in corrupt

Everything I touch turns to ashes
Falls away, it falls away
Everything I touch turns to ashes
It slips right through my hands

Love me, hate me
Isolate me every day that I'm alive
Straight-up mentally unstable
You don't have to like my life

I'm a jinx, a curse; some say, ""The worst""
I'm a savage, rabid beast
I've been called so many fucking things
It doesn't affect me in the least!
I've stolen, lied, been crucified
But I don't regret a thing
I'm an egocentric masochist
With a sadist's point of bleak

Everything I touch turns to ashes
Falls away, it falls away
Everything I touch turns to ashes
It slips right through my hands

Love me, hate me
Isolate me every day that I'm alive
Live to prove you wrong, it's easy
When your heart is filled with ice
Chapters in my life define me
Changed me into this deprived
Straight-up mentally unstable
You don't have to like my life

Everything I touch turns to ashes
Falls away, it falls away
Everything I touch turns to ashes
It slips right through my hands"
1,The Way of the Fist,"Break this shit down!
Zoltan, open the sky!

You want it, you got it
Everything you needed and more
You said it; I heard it
Careful what you wish for
Deleted, defeated, everything you've ever been
No mercy, it's the way of the fist

Strapped with rage, got no patience for victims
Sick and tired of the whole fuckin' world

I don't remember asking you about your imperfections
You might win one battle
But know this: I'll win the fucking war!

End of the goddamn road! (Right!)

Step to me, step to me, motherfucker
Zip your lip, you've run out of time
Step to me, step to me, motherfucker
Talk the talk now, walk the damn line

Deserve it; you earned it, got yourself a fuckin' war
Believe it; you need it, facedown on the fuckin' floor
I hate it; can't take it
Wanna break your fuckin' bones
No mercy, you faggot
Should've left it all alone

Strapped with rage; got no patience for victims
Sick and tired of the whole fuckin' world

I don't remember asking you about your imperfections
You might win one battle
But know this: I'll win the fucking war!

As you crash and burn
One, two, fuck you! (Right!)

Step to me, step to me, motherfucker
Zip your lip, you've run out of time
Step to me, step to me, motherfucker
Talk the talk; now walk the damn line
Step to me, step to me, motherfucker
Shut your face; it's your turn to die
Step to me, step to me, anybody
Talk the shit, your ass is mine

I don't remember asking you about your imperfections
You might win one battle
But know this: I'll win the fucking war!"
