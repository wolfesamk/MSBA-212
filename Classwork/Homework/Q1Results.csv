1MZEvcHipP8,How_Gurren_Lagann_Answers_Evangelion, art is a reflection of the society in which it comes from and as such it will ask its audience questions to consider for example at a glance finding nemo examines the dangers of over parenting your kid and turning them into a rebellious spiteful [ __ ] and also letting go as a parent or something i don't know that's not as interesting to me take any other piece of art is your choice and i'm sure you would find that it asks its own set of questions now let me ask you a question have you ever been engaging with a piece of media and you see it possesses many of the same themes as earlier works you've engaged with but when you start to examine this piece and the one with similar ideas you realize that this new piece was created almost as an exact thematic inverse of the previous one in other words they ask the same questions but they give opposite answers gurren lagann is a show which really interests me not in isolation mind you but how it functions as a meta response to another anime from 13 years earlier that many of these same people also helped created all right let's take a step back for a second in 1995 gynax releases the mecha anime neon genesis a van gaalion a passion project of the then experienced animator hidekiano in this project anno sought to explore his own depression and psychological issues the result of doing this was a tv anime which stood in pretty stark contrast to its predecessors whereas before the pilots and mecca shows had been noble brave and willing to protect their people the main character shinji lives an abject terror of the duty placed upon him while i don't doubt that shinji is written this way because it is reflective of anno's own feelings it should also be noted that anno is someone who has continually called for the anime industry to innovate and avoid stagnation creating a protagonist in this vein was yet another way to stand out from the crowd after the release of a van gaalion the state of anime was changed forever there are many videos which exist on the subject but i think one of the most interesting and illuminating comparisons i have heard drawn is that what star wars is to america evangelion is to japan ubiquitous culturally important and revolutionary just as star wars spawned the blockbuster evangelion spawned the original tv anime and just as you can eventually trace the success of almost any blockbuster to star wars the same holds true for original anime after evangelion unsurprisingly then many shows which followed ava decided to borrow from its tone and themes i'm sure both for financial capitalization and creative inspiration but now let's go back again to 1995 when the director of gurren lagann is handed his first job in the industry hiroyuki amishi first got his start working as a key animator on evangelion from there he worked with gainax over the years on many other projects until finally getting his first directing role on tenga tapa gurren lagann now while evangelion is undoubtedly the brainchild of hidekiano such a direct connection cannot be made for gurren lagann hiroyuki notes that gurren lagann was a project which already existed before he was appointed director when it came to pre-production much of the project was already planned out before he was put in charge but he does note that he did have some discretion and obviously injected his own ideas and influence when asked about the unbridled optimism present in gurren lagann hiroyuki ties his answer directly into neon genesis a van gaalion he acknowledges that after neon genesis evangelion there's a time when the protagonist would refuse to pilot mecca it was almost an antithesis to what mecha anime had been during the 70s and 80s that you piloted mecca willingly and fought hard however with neon genesis a van gaalion refusing to pilot mecca embodied the youth of that era these things are cyclical though again it's like poetry so if they rhyme as when i was working on gurren lagann there was too much of this refusal type attitude from my standpoint if someone asked me to pilot a mecca i would even if they said i wasn't allowed to as far as i have dug this is one of the only direct refutations hiroyuki acknowledges to be present in gurren lagann there are other interviews which acknowledge the obvious impact of evangelion on the show but few others which say because ava did this we did the opposite still from that we can garner that there was at least somewhat of a concerted effort to refute the tropes and attitudes the studio itself had caused to permeate the industry which is why i think now is the appropriate time to ask a big and important question one that will help lay the groundwork for the rest of this analysis what is the message of a van gaalion and what is the message of gurren lagann evangelion is a show about loneliness depression how we relate to other people and the ultimate futility in all of it despite everyone's best efforts the main characters grow increasingly estranged from one another as the story progresses to the point where shinji masato rey and asuka will no longer speak to one another by the final episodes the payoff of this unrelation comes in the end of evangelion where it appears the vast majority of humanity chooses to forego its individuality combine into a giant space creature and give up on the idea of being a human because it's too difficult gurren lagann is a show which aims to demonstrate precisely the opposite gurren lagann is a show about how human progression can ultimately backfire and bring about harm to ourselves yet despite this fact humanity continually decides to deal with that hardship and play with that fire asserting that being a human being is awesome fighting is awesome when the world is in a state of peace we see the characters overcome with tedium only when all these disjointed vibrant and clashing personalities work together to overcome a great obstacle do they appear to be enjoying themselves from here we can see the fundamental difference which helps to understand how these shows are related while the characters in evangelion struggle to live the characters in gurren lagann live to struggle evangelion detests our constant fighting while gurren lagann embraces it and that simple distinction helps illuminate why these two plots stand as inversions of each other evangelion thrives in a state of breakdown everything is always broken the avas are always breaking the characters are mentally breaking the city the world and eventually the entire human race break down evangelion asserts that our differences will drive us apart piece by piece person by person city by city until the whole world ceases to exist gurren lagann starts in a fractured world and builds it into a better society the key to this progression is combining once communist steals a gunman he insists that simone and him combine in order to increase their attack power simone continues to combine throughout the series with robots that grow increasingly larger every time when simone combines with someone the two people do not merge their consciousness into one but rather coordinate their separate distinct movements in order to defeat their enemies these two approaches are also reflected in the plot structure the people of tokyo three wait for threats to approach them and rarely do the characters in avan galeon stray from outside the city they're helpless with little agency doing the best they can to fend off foreign threats but this is ultimately an ineffectual effort it's saying even if you stand still and live conservatively everything will still break around you gurin lagann rarely stays in one place the story is a constant journey trekking across the earth's surface and eventually the entire galaxy humanity could choose to ignore the threats and live underground but they deliberately meet and challenge whatever stands in the way of human progress it instead says in order to continue humanity must charge forward up to this point i have focused on direct inversions things in gurren lagann that seemed to directly spit in the face of avangelion but not everything that happens in gurren is so directly defiant in fact there are many characters events and underlying ideas which are similar but one delineation that helps explain how these similarities ultimately look for in side by side is the tone i want to look at one theme which occurs in both shows time and time again sexuality it's the sex when asked what sex is evangelion shows it at its most awkward uncomfortable confusing frustrating and unhealthy states shinji's affection for the women in his life is totally repressed he constantly denies his urges whenever they're brought to attention by another character and i don't have to mention this scene do i but even beyond our main character there's still plenty of weird sex to go around most solo scenes of asuka show that she is also confused about her own feelings for kaji and shinji but really the character who exemplifies this the most is of course misato despite having pretty bitter feelings towards kaji and realizing he makes a bad partner misato ultimately reforms a sexual relationship with him when we first see her go to sleep with him it's after months of grueling depressing hard work this is the relief in her life she doesn't do it because she loves kaji or at least this isn't her primary reason at first she does it because she needs to because she can't make it through her job without it it's portrayed to be as unhealthy as it sounds however i am willing to acknowledge that this interpretation of misato might be doing her character a little bit of disservice i think misato's sexuality does go a lot deeper because ultimately it seems to be her character's primary mode of expression that said it still comes across as a little unhealthy now before we move on i want to ask you guys a question what does the first kiss look like in evangelion yikes it's awkward borderline harassment tense and honestly does nothing to put me in the mood if anything it makes me wildly uncomfortable now when we look at kamina and yoko's scene [Music] wow much better you get your man yoko now most of you probably think guru lagan doesn't even really address sex i mean it's not in this series explicitly at any point but just because there is no sex doesn't mean there is no sexuality i'd argue if anything gurren lagann fully embraces sex far more than its spiritual predecessor there's a reason yoko dresses like a stripper you know but besides getting horny chains to watch this show and there's a reason kamina and simone also walk around half naked it's because here they are expressing sexuality rather than repressing sexuality it isn't weird or shameful for them to walk around shirtless it's awesome in some ways it's a middle finger to avangelion for acting like this stuff is something to be shameful of and speaking of middle finger watch how these two shows handle the rules of their universe and exposition [Music] [Music] [Applause] gets wrapped up in the particulars and absorbs so much screen time in its own science gurn lagann essentially says who gives a [ __ ] how any of this works we don't care you don't care we want to watch robots beat the [ __ ] out of each other but honestly that's all miners stuff to me the biggest refutation comes in the form of this guy right here kamina before we come to understand why kamina is so important i think we should compare the two series protagonists simone and shinji simone and shinji are both younger teenagers on the cusp to come of age we witness both of them get sucked into a conflict they didn't ask for live in the shadow of the competent people around them and continually struggle with self-confidence and doubt they both start as the type of characters where if they felt they could be doing anything else they probably would be the only thing which continually compels them to return to fighting is the people around them yet despite similar starts simone and shinji end as completely different characters and the difference can be understood most well in the difference between kamina and misato at early points in both series the protagonists try to run away from their duty in avangelion when shinji tries to leave he is met with scorn shame and an angered indifference masato says i don't give a [ __ ] do what you want doom this city if you god damn please and shinji almost goes through with this on several occasions much like how a child can grow up with low confidence due to the way a parent raises them shinji is not encouraged with love to take up his duties he is only punished with exile if he chooses to abandon his cause simone also has a similar moment early on but rather than shame him for being scared kamina aims to inspire him he says to simone you aren't running away from this because i need you i won't let you do that and you can bet that i will also play support to you the relationship here is clearly much less distant as an interesting thought experiment i want you to imagine kamina is placed in the evangelion and he meets the main characters as they act cold and distant kamino would respond with confusion he would call them out for their depressing behavior and tell them to lighten up as shinji would stand scared in front of the ava for the first time kamino would laugh and just push him into it a character like him could likely snap everyone into a new mode of thinking and restore morale through his motivational speeches to put it simply kamina is the ultimate manly hype man but of course i've danced around something large in the previous paragraph the real reason simone undergoes a dramatic character change and the elephant in the room for anyone who has watched gurren lagann is that kamina dies following kamina's death we witness simone break down and enter a very similar state of depression to shinji in the early episodes of evangelion and understandably so his best friend got murdered in front of him due to his own ineptitude while this almost pushes simone to abandon fighting he ultimately realizes that since kamina is gone someone has to step up and lead team lagaan he knows he can never be kamina but he doesn't have to he is simone and by that point simone is good enough to lead the group in other words he has accepted his role gained his confidence and come to terms with his place in the world shinji never gets such an arc now while masato does ultimately die at the end of avangelion shinji doesn't directly witness it and not enough time passes after this incident to understand how this might have impacted his character had misato died in episode 12 or so would shinji have been more inspired to fight or would he have run away ultimately this is speculation but i leaned towards saying he probably would have run away because masato never inspired shinji she chastised him she berated him she expressed extreme disapproval but she never gave him a sufficient personal reason to fight the difference in how simone and shinji develop from relatively the same place is not an internal difference in reaction but an external difference in their interpersonal relationships with those close to them if you put kamina in masato's place and misato and kamina's place it's likely shinji would end up being more confident and competent while simone would ultimately retreat into cowardice while we're on character analogs let's discuss two more characters with parallel roles yoko and osuka is an interesting one because while i'd say they largely fall into the same archetype they pretty much exist at opposite spectrums of the term tsundere yes asuka is very cold the shinji and yoko is very combative to kamina but right off the bat it's very obvious that yoko has feelings for kamina and while they bicker or occasionally annoy one another you never get the sense they actually dislike each other yoko is annoyed by kamina but she likes to be annoyed by kamina compare this to asuka and my god is there a stark difference asaka can be [ __ ] brutal to shinji calling him weak incompetent a loser on my planet i am kind of a loser like you there really is just this sense of jealousy and vitriol that forms their toxic bond whereas yoko may not express her feelings well but ultimately accepts them asaka's envy takes over her entire personality she won't let herself say how she feels to shinji because she refuses to acknowledge that weakness in her character that she can't attain perfection on her own and that someone might be better at her job than she is this toxic horrible and unhealthy expression of her emotions is part of the reason shinji ultimately tries to choke her at the end of avon galleon in a horrifying and striking final shot i might add can you imagine any of yoko's allies in the series coming to choke her out i can't imagine that happening for three seconds and i think that fundamentally speaks about how different yoko and asuka are despite technically occupying the same trope oh and before you guys misinterpret this or take me out of context [Music] finally let's get to the two characters who serve a similar thematic and story role rey and nia two characters who have trouble expressing their emotions that appear human but in reality are not two characters who are portrayed giant and naked against the backdrop of space at the end of the story and two characters who are literally the key to the series climax and finale so what defines the differences between rey and nia well in some ways it's everything nia is someone who talks endlessly but whose words are confusing while rey is someone who is quiet and precise in her language but rarely lets anyone peek into her mind both these characters are constantly misunderstood by those around them but where rey reacts with indifference nia will prattle on with jargon until the person she is speaking to understands what she is trying to say this again reflects the tonal difference between the shows shinji's relationship with rey is stilted and awkward but admittedly has its heartfelt moments whereas simone and nia's relationship is pretty much just made as cute and lovable as possible just look at them adorable i'll admit i didn't see this connection at first it wasn't until nia was displayed against the moon in some weird alien form then it clicked for me how these characters were thematically similar look i i know i'm dumb okay this is the most obvious thing if you think about it for more than three seconds i just wasn't seeing it i was too busy taking notes on literal events to see the full picture i'm so sorry and speaking of the moon i don't need to explain this connection do it [Music] in evangelion we fly to the moon anger in the gun the moon flies into us now with many of the differences i have mentioned thus far one factor to account for these which should not be neglected is the difference in genre evangelion is a science fiction show and gurren lagann is an adventure fantasy it's the reason one show looks bleak and desaturated while the other is one of the most beautiful pieces of animation ever conceived that's not to say ava doesn't look great it looks incredible at its own gritty style but gurnen lagann aims to be sexy and colorful and it hits the nail on the head in that regard this is also largely the same reason after mentioned exposition is treated as a waste of time in one show an important gospel in the other and since i've already said the word gospel let's talk about religion yeah that's always a fun sentence to hear [Music] neon genesis evangelion translates roughly to new century gospel with gospel meaning good news and also of course a reference to jesus christ the savior in the christian religion despite its title evangelion doesn't directly address religion anywhere in the show at least in an explicit manner but the themes and logics of religion permeate the characters and events that unfold every impact in evangelion is described as a mythical event the characters seem to have an understanding of it that parallels the way religion describes the end times characters fear of another impact in much the same way christians fear or deloitte and depending on who you are the prophecies contained in the book of revelations now if what i just said is a stretch to some of you and you don't entirely agree i don't blame you i'll admit this isn't the strongest argument i've put forth here but where you can't refute the similarities is in the ending neon genesis evangelion ends with the instrumentality project a project which aims to break down all differences between human beings and coalesce into perfect harmony with each other and the world now shinji ultimately rejects this but we'll get to that in a second i can't speak much for the paradise described in other religions but the idea of perfect harmony is something which comes up a lot in christianity heaven is described as being a place absent of human emotions and differences where everyone lives in eternity and happiness catholic christianity purports that our goal is to make a heaven of earth to take the steps necessary to secure harmony and peace here to make this world as great as possible in that way the instrumentality project is undeniably inspired from catholic christian ideals now i'm sure a priest or religious scholar will poke holes in this as catholicism asks people to willingly choose god and they'll see this method as cheating or somehow against the rules but whether it actually conforms to religious doctrine is not really the point the point is that given a reading of the bible it's understandable how someone could conclude this would be a perfect enactment of those ideals in other words the character's religion and belief that humanity is an inferior species wrought with some kind of sinner flaw leads them to this conclusion girl legon addresses religion in a much more direct manner right from the moment kamina meets the underground priests he seeks to dismantle their beliefs he gets to press when he sees the priest has unknowingly manipulated an entire town into fear of the outside he wants them to be free to face the fears head on and believe in themselves rather than a higher power and this is a theme which is constantly reiterated the value of humanity is declared time and time again and it's made most obvious in the finale when the human race has to go up against the anti-spirals after rejecting the spiral king in his traditional way of doing things humanity is punished with attempted damnation an extinction by the anti-spirals creatures who might as well be gods but rather than bow down to these godlike creatures and accept their fate humanity decides they must battle them to secure the future of their species even if they are technically inferior even if their actions push the universe into a more dangerous place the human race ultimately decides that it cannot be shackled to any gods and must decide for itself what their duty is one moment which really epitomizes the difference in these philosophies comes at the tail end of both series when shinji enters the instrumentality project he rejects it he decides that living in perfect harmony no matter how much better it may seem is ultimately a farce anyone who partakes in the instrumentality project is forfeiting their humanity therefore shinji acknowledges and accepts that the human race must always be less than the universe and gurren lagann ends with them combining into a robot bigger than the size of the entire universe asserting that if we push ourselves to our limits and work with one another we can literally accomplish the impossible but this power is only possible because the characters in the lagon refuse to accept the rules of reality for what they are and refuse to be bound by some notion of a higher power the natural outcomes of this is reflected in the state of the species planet and universe at the end of both shows at the end of evangelion most of humanity has left the earth the planet has transformed into a wasteland humanity lives in perfect harmony but by that point they really aren't human anymore and they never can grow and learn beyond that final point of the instrumentality project at the end of lagon there is no implied perfect harmony or utopian world but rather humanity accepts the world isn't perfect that their power may lead to their demise if they aren't careful yet despite the risks involved they accept the challenges are worth it anyway and set out on a new mission to meet alien lifeforms it scoffs at ava you can't even settle your own differences we're going to make friends across the galaxy because why not the whole time this question has seemed to be the key difference ava asks why and gurren asks why not or why are you choosing to see it that way why is sexuality awkward well why does it have to be why is everything a constant battle why do you want things to be easy why are we all so different why can't we understand each other why would you want us to be the same isn't our differences in individuality when combined what makes us so great why can't humanity move in a constant state of harmony why wouldn't you want humanity to continually evolve into something better i can't stress enough how i think of these shows as companion pieces two halves of a whole that seek to answer the same questions with different answers so really what does that mean well i think it represents a choice not for the characters who constantly embody these ideals and personality traits but for us the viewers the only ones who can experience both these worlds watching neon genesis evangelion and tenga toppa gurren lagann back to back is an exercise in perspective it is an implicit reminder that there are two sides to every story and that neither one of them may necessarily be right or wrong only that they both exist in reality there are many many many sides to every story and this just happens to be a case of two diametrically opposed shows displaying similar conundrums with the key difference between both series not being the conflict itself but how the characters choose to handle it and now here comes the peanut gallery's extrapolated advice ready three two one there are always going to be factors you can't control for and things that make life more difficult but perhaps in adjusting your perspective you can better manage those brutal blows you might be dealt feel sadness when it is appropriate and fight to claw your way out of depression when it is not in essence if you want to end up like simone more often than you end up like shinji control for what is controllable embrace the good times as much as you can find hobbies and interests that make your life rewarding and if something suddenly becomes very hard keep trying at it for a while it may just be a small bump in the road finally and this is most important if you find yourself being beckoned back by your estranged father on your 14th birthday pilot the damn robot thanks for watching please like comment and subscribe let's abuse that sweet juicy algorithm i'm going to leave some other random similarities and differences in the notes section of the description there was a lot of stuff that i either felt like didn't need more than a sentence to explain or just somehow didn't fit into this video uh second piece of housekeeping so i have a feeling there might be two very specific disagreements people have with this video one pertaining to why the ava rebuild movies were not mentioned and another which sees this as cherry picking because i ignored all the other guy next shows between evangelion and gurren lagann and uh i i had tangents about this like originally elsewhere in the script but i just really thought it didn't fit so i decided to put them in a separate video where i just kind of talk over a still picture for anyone curious how i might answer either of those two questions they're really just random asides and if they don't bother you then there's no reason to watch that video it's unlisted anyway i'm not trying to get a lot of people to watch it i don't want people to watch it who saw this video first that's why i'm separate that's why it's the way it is finally what do you guys think was i totally off base did i take my analysis too far what did i miss what did i hit the nail on the head for who do you think is the hottest adult character across both series let me know in the comments below,The PNUT Gallery
Z_moLda_du4,How_Gurren_Laganns_Storytelling_Tricks_You, the introductory segment of Gurren Lagann has always been interesting to meet personally for a number of reasons it does a lot that one would expect an establishing section to do introducing an epic scope building the world and very quickly adhering the audience to the characters and main mantra of the world it is also quite different stylistically from the rest of the story with the tone and feel of the progression and conflicts giving off a bit of a deceptive impression of where the story might be headed but related to this stylistic approach what is so interesting about this opening act is that it is a narrative red herring something verging on a masterstroke of expectation subversion and what's important is that this is not a subversion done for subversion sake but something completely consistent with the way this universe and the characters within its function and thus a benefit to the story looking at it retrospectively it is intentionally what many would consider the weakest act using very logical reasons that can only be deduced after you know the entire story to perpetuate an impression of false one dimensionality however before expanding on this let's get into a couple of traditional criticisms that can be levied at the early episodes of Gurren Lagann before discussing how these elements are actually very appropriate even if it doesn't change the fact that a good portion of these episodes are pretty silly first of all it can be hard for new Watchers to feel some genuine weight and investment in the events and conflicts early on simply because the show doesn't really take them seriously with a slight exception of episode 7 there is very little tension in any of these battles even if our heroes genuinely have a difficult time and don't end up winning now this can be explained due to the general tone of these episodes being won a pretty light-hearted adventure with the emphasis on overcoming the odds but I think a bigger reason for this is in the characterization and approach taken with the villains these adversaries are simply put shallow ranging from the random grunts who are essentially cheesy cannon fodder to virile who despite being comfortably the most important antagonist here is sometimes even treated as comic relief early on the antagonists are hardly given any weight and are quite devoid of substance such a pity that they're not fleshed out there's no depth and we aren't given any explanations for their motivations other than them needing to kill the humans for some reason they are not treated as anything other than humorous obstacles and this makes it difficult to care much and to be emotionally invested the first time around the second supposin criticism here is probably the most controversial yet significant one that has been leveled at the series and it pertains to our beloved leader the driving force for these opening episodes kameena is the endearing determined leader of team Dai guren and retrospectively it's easy to look at him with rose tinted glasses but he doesn't appear here to be an extremely balanced character and one could be forgiven for feeling like his brand of leadership leaves a bit to be desired kameena is essentially the symbol of the show the thematic drill from which the entire narrative bases itself off of so one would assume that his display of leadership would be traditionally exemplary inspirational and charismatic but backed up with extreme interpersonal intelligence a knack for strategy and a knowledge and demonstration of the best course of action in varying circumstances but quite frankly kameena does not meet those specific expectations in full he's charismatic confident and he leads by example but ultimately what he boils down to is someone who spouts the same platitudes without much variation recklessly and foolishly leading into battle outwardly being a bit of a bonehead goof used for comedy a lot of the time rather than a genuine stable Lee Durer kameena essentially just repeatedly says the same few phrases over and over with the hopes that drilling in this philosophy will bring about positive results and apart from a few very subtle hints about his father and a couple of key quotes this early arc doesn't really try to add many dimensions to him but although he is scoffed at by some characters the story by and large treats him like the pinnacle of inspiration its creates some dissonance between what is being portrayed proportionate to what the story perceives that importance to be and this combined with the cannon fodder approach to antagonists that I mentioned leads to a feeling of superficiality gravitas is important and apart from the stories admirable philosophy and good world building it's hard to become invested when the show doesn't give you many reasons to but the end of episode 8 understandably changes everything and the story does a 180 though the introduction of Nia gradually brings the story back to its light-hearted fun the dynamics are changed everything now has weight themes of self-actualization and grief are introduced moving on from the death of a loved one and integrating their memory while being your own person the inner duality of all these characters becomes more apparent the plot opens up antagonists with gravity are introduced true development occurs the universe mechanics are delved into and the story is benefited exponentially by this comparatively the introductory episodes are probably the relatively weakest section of the show and one could definitely understand why they might be hard to buy into for some Watchers things are established well from the beginning but despite that everything seems a bit shallow but that is the point it is shallow because these characters are simply putting on an act or playing a role doing what they need to do rather than what they truly feel because of their personal circumstances we find out later that in the hopes of combating the spiral nemesis and maintaining the survival of the world's a custom of tyranny has been established to keep populations below the limit as such the setting is one of utmost oppression and the people have learned generation after generation that there is no point to hope for a better future the legacy passed down is one of fear and learned helplessness for the oppressed but what's key here is that it is also true for the oppressors there are two sides to this the beasts men and especially virile they have no idea why they're doing what they're doing they've just been told to hunt and hate humans by lord genome and their superiors some may enjoy this but there is no deeply-rooted substantial motivation other than killing for an unknown duty and that is why they're so shallow just as the people in the underground villages they are told what to do and told not to ask questions a thematic mirror image of those they are hunting there is no weight to these characters early on because they have no conviction they're only carrying out roles handed down all the way from the anti spirals to combat the spiral nemesis and we see later on that Veera was never really that type of person in the first place which adds much-needed context to the supposed lack of punch to him as an antagonist at heart he really isn't much of a villain anyway so why should there be a false conviction to his actions these villains being superficial was entirely appropriate both logically and thematically and it is quite a poignant idea after all the closest thing to a villain in Gurren Lagann is the abstract idea that you cannot achieve the seemingly impossible now for kameena there is an even better reason and more emotional weight tied to his narrow-minded stubborn one-dimensional approach kameena lives as the legacy of a great man his father was truly impressive able to make it to the surface and explore the unknown as communists stayed in GEHA village too afraid to follow at the start of the series he breaks through to the surface to reach his father and after seeing his corpse he pursues the improbable in the hopes of restoring humanity to the surface and building the prosperous world that his father sought but on his own he does not know how to do this he admits that he'd be lost without the brains and solid foundation that semen provides him and he is all too aware of his limitations Oh - awwww yeeeaaah what else but he is also way more intelligent than he lets on and he acts the way he does partly because he knows Simone's limitations - he wants to be the person everyone needs even if he didn't know how to be more he doesn't know how to be a great leader he's just doing what he knows just doing his best projecting an opposite reaction to the insecurities that he actually feels to try and inspire those around him kameena genuinely sacrifices quite a bit during his time in Gurren Lagann this persona is without doubt a big part of him but he exaggerates it wearing a mask to be the hero that these people needed maybe not the perfect leader now but the type of symbol who would later inspire one and he also knows that Simone is currently a bit lost himself so he is exactly what he needs to be to inspire his brother the words the agency the Brawn he does not need a brain and he does not need resourcefulness because Simone already has that stolen undermine America's trigga honoka's Kiyomi Romania mine is dimension I gotta mining we see Ronnie me Naruto luminita kookie

determination and a knowledge of one's strengths waves can be made and the world can be changed it's not until his absence that the value of his words and presence is really felt and that tells you all you need to know about kameena a man who despite his flaws was exactly who he needed to be for all of those around him who put on a stupid valiant mask and persevered when he himself didn't really have that much confidence doing it the only way he knew how not the perfect leader not the perfect man but a true hero nonetheless the opening act is arguably the weakest one in this show for this general feeling of generic shallowness in some aspects but that is an illusion a false display that the story tricks you with that can only be realized afterwards on the first watch one wonders why there is such little gravitas to these encounters why the show treats kameena as a hero when he seems more like a reckless idiot why virile is treated as comic relief when he's the closest thing to a big bad villain but it all flips on its head through a clever ironic tonal wink to this deception there's no gravitas to these encounters because the beast men never really had their heart in it kameena is treated as a hero despite repeating the same seemingly insubstantial platitudes because he is a hero just doing the best that he can and because those platitudes are given wait later now don't mistake me this is all an extremely risky maneuver and the fact that perspective criticism is countered by later events does not completely make the shallow or dumb moments more enjoyable for those who didn't like it in the first place it is likely a big reason as to why a lot of people drop it early on and disregard the series as stupid and that is a bit of a problem but regardless there is no disputing that this twist is intelligent and adds a new layer of appreciation to the series characteristic of the duality that it operates in note that I don't mean to imply that these opening episodes were all a complete 100 percent intentional facade that the writers decided to pull I'm simply pointing out that there is narrative logic behind these aspects but there were plenty of other functions the early relatively more lighthearted tone is a good way to organically make these characters endearing and a great way to habituate the watcher to the mundane so that the hammer blows later on achieve maximum effect as said earlier the sense of epic scope is palpable from episode 1 the concept of drilling to the heavens a theme from the start episode 5 for shadows the later revelations about the spiral nemesis and introduces the societal implications of this forced oppression on the beings of this world and the early lines from Ross you hint at how he becomes a man who he warns the others against the whole it is too much also as early as episode 1 we are able to see little glimpses of Simone's inner thrill-seeker his exhilaration and deep yearning for a place beyond what seems possible hidden underneath his cowardly comfort seeking exterior we are also given little bits of symbolic and thematic foreshadowing such as the way Simone pilots the brain and calming up pilots the heart or the Cape motif through the Cape communist father passes his will on to him and he passes that spirit into Simone through the little bit that rips off it's just a subtle little bit of theming about legacy learning about those who have touched your life integrating them within to make yourself a better person through their spirit while also being your own person so it's clear that there are a multitude of functional foundations set in this act but they're ever so slightly hidden beneath these antics overshadowed by this falsely superficial feel and a tone that while deceptive is completely consistent and logical given the story that we are witnessing it's a series of personas of masks a really quite meta elements that the series achieves here through some emotional theming while also being the fun unpredictable thrill ride that we all know to love many thanks for watching,Aleczandxr
9m19OsgLMkI,Gurren_Laganns_Underappreciated_Maturity, [Music] tengen toppa gurren lagaan has always been a series that was on my radar it's a show that had been in my plan to watch lists for ages almost since I first started watching anime in mid 2015 I had just never gotten around to watching it for one reason or another but since I started this channel and got past more than a couple hundred subscribers I'd have almost weekly comments on my video is recommending that I check it out when I finally started shifting my responses from I'm planning on Washington eventually - I am literally about to started this weekend I was met with an interesting response about 75% of people were absolutely stoked and said that I have a wonderful time with one of the greatest anime of the past ten years or perhaps ever the remainder were more hesitant saying that they didn't think the anime was for me that it would be too stupid for my tastes and that it was just too nonsensical for them to get much out of it it seemed to me like it was quite polarizing with a very large majority having loved it in a very vocal minority thinking of it as a waste of time but something that I found interesting about gurren lagaan perception was that a ton of people even the ones who loved it seemed to boil the appeal of the series down to simple stupid ethnic legendary fun there was little mention of any real somatic depth or nuance when talking about the appeal of the series and I know that there are people who appreciate gurren lagaan for the deeper and more complex things that it achieves but by and large the perception seems to be that this is a series that is absolutely amazing as long as you don't think too hard about it and I think that this does a big disservice to a really well-done aspect of the series now of course the show finds its identity and its larger-than-life characters that display universe defying perseverance through the thrilling action and the pure boldness and vibrancy exploding for most of the frames but these characteristics are all stylistically ingrained and gurren lagaan design simply put these broad strokes ideas are what made gurren lagaan a modern classic more or less but for me it was the finer details the surprisingly intricate criminally underplayed ideas that impressed me the most the point of this video is not the state that the main strength of the show were not terrific but to instead bring attention to the understated assets of the series stemming from some very mature ideas that I observed during the middle episodes roughly from around episode 8 to the story beats before the final battle but before I get into those ideas allow me to digress and get my thoughts on gurren lagaan style these days I'm pretty good at going into fiction with a fresh mind which is lucky because earlier in my life I tended to let hype ruin some great stories for myself so with gurren lagaan I was able to go into it with basically no expectations other than to hopefully have a fun time throughout the 27 episodes and witness a ton of crazy stuff throughout the first six or seven episodes I'd say I was enjoying it the battles were fun it's a bit predictable the characters were memorable and I was pretty into some of the societal world building tidbits established through episode fives village of a die and of course I adored communi but in these episodes I began to see why a common criticism of the series the fact that so much crazy and nonsensical stuff happens throughout would not really be a problem with me in any story I consider a plot event to be out of place or a detrimental flaw to the story if it is inconsistent with the rules previously established in said story through dialogue world-building tone and more a good example of one of these inconsistencies is present in the Harry Potter series in this series witches and wizards the younger than seventeen are not allowed to perform magic outside of school there is something called a magical trace which can detect when magic is used in the proximity of an underage wizard and notifies the Ministry of Magic who respond quickly to investigate why the magic occurred and usually hand out punishments this happens in numerous times throughout the series with Harry being contacted by the ministry for magic occurring around him outside of school both in cases where he himself performed the magic and in cases where someone else did however there are so many points in the story where magic is performed outside of school in the presence of underage wizards and the ministry does not follow up on it the lack of ministry action is not ever explained either so I consider this to be a flaw in the story because it contradicts rules that had been established in universe previously now relating to that the reason that I don't have a problem with gurren lagaan is overblown approach to storytelling is that it doesn't really break any of its own rules the thing is the rules established within the show in the first few episodes and much later on are so loose that basically anything goes within the confines of the narrative there are so few restrictions as to what can be achieved in this world and while I can see how that fact in itself could be a problem with some people it's undeniable that this design choice integrates beautifully with one of the main themes of the series the theme of persevering against all odds to achieve great things and that's fine by me so if someone has a genuine problem with the design of gurren lagaan 'he's ridiculously insane story the fact is that it likely isn't a flaw the fact is that this type of story where everything goes probably just isn't for that and that's completely fine but I do find it unfair to ridicule a story for consistently sticking to an over-the-top style that it establishes so early on Seamon and friends literally travel through space and time using emotional connection and the power of fighting spirit yeah sure why not the draw of the show is not in a tightly written and rigid script but in the ideas and themes that can be communicated thanks in part to a setting where anything can be achieved now in a show more grounded in reality or with tighter rules this insanity would be a problem but in guru McGann it works and because of this I was able to brush aside any issues and focus purely on the aspects of the story that I had great interest in and like I said before in doing this I found some really well-executed and interesting ideas I'm sure like many of you the main draw to the series and the main thing that kept me going through the early episodes was kameena his appeal is hard to put into words and actually goes beyond words in some ways a man so open minded adventurous bold and willing to take life by the scruff of the neck would naturally be the focal point of the story his personality was absolutely infectious and it's mindless ambition fierce determination and endeavours for a life greater than what he had been told was possible he was able to live without restrictions in a way that augmented the themes of the show and he reminded me quite a bit of one of my favorite fictional characters ever Tyler Durden from Fight Club naturally a personality this big was a gigantic part of the story so when our hero met his end the impact of the death had on the characters and stories was monumental kameena was the focus point and driving force of the story a man that impacted each and every one of the characters in one way or another so naturally his end and his actions in the world left a huge void for the episodes after calming his death there was a distinct something that was lacking everything was a bit less vibrant and colorful and really quite depressing because of this the plot hits a bit of a lull here in terms of pacing and direction and this is why I think a lot of people dislike this part of the show it was all a bit dreary and aimless wallowing in grief and fixated on the depression that Simone was experiencing but the thing is I think that the viewer is supposed to feel this I think that we were meant to vicariously experience what Simone was feeling and I can't speak for anyone else but it worked for me I was in a pretty awful mood State in the few episodes after Kammenos goodbye and I really wasn't having a good time with the show at this point but this fact in itself was what was needed for gurren lagaan to communicate its ideas on coping with the death of a seemingly irreplaceable person if you lost anyone in your life then you know that the aftermath can be unbearable at times you may start looking at everyday situations and thinking about how that lost person may act in these instances seeing scenarios of daily life that tend to emphasize the void that the individual has left behind and this is exactly what happens in gurren lagaan with Simone and his reaction to communist death Simone's perception is that kameena was everything and he always was so enamored with the man that he never stopped to think about his place in the world without him so when he was gone Simone would always think about how he wasn't good enough to be communist and how he would never live up to him without thinking that he had his own strengths he kept thinking about how wrong it was that Camino was gone from the world but he eventually reached the conclusion that he was not good enough simply because he was not communist he tried and failed to emulate kameena but this was totally the wrong approach and one that was pretty poignant in his execution it took a third party one with a fresh perspective to bring him out of this funk nia is the only one in the story that sees Simone strengths but is unable to compare him to communi and this helps Iman to slowly but surely discover his self-worth in doing so he organically discovers the healthiest way possible for him to cope with Carmina Simone begins to realize that he was as valuable to kameena as Camino was to him and using this knowledge he responds in a really beautiful way instead of seeking to emulate his bro Simone empowers himself using the memory of Camino Simone uses the lessons he learned from him and certain aspects of communist personality and actually embodies them to find a way past his own personal struggles in doing this he becomes a man who is shades of communist added to a new and improved simile he empowers himself by embodying the life lessons that calming a taught him and adding them to a man who is still very much Simone the bigger at heart it was a striking metamorphosis that I thought gurren lagaan executed very well death is something that really doesn't have any set response due to how deeply it can affect people and because of this reactions to it can be portrayed wonderfully in many ways in media there are people that learn too fondly remember past loved ones and allow themselves to be empowered by the story of their life as explored in gurren lagaan there are some that simply never come to terms with the death of a loved one and there are some that forget about past loved ones death can be dealt with in so many ways and I really have to applaud gurren lagaan for displaying a very healthy and quite inspirational approach to dealing with it this approach was heartfelt you're not unrealistic or cringy striking a very sensible balance and it really was the biggest strength of the show for me another of my favorite parts of the show was centered in the story points or at the very least a character who tends to get a lot of flak Ross you Ross use gradual betrayal of Simone after the time-skip is a plot event that is met with contempt by many to this day but for me it was a great stretch of storytelling covering ideas that I definitely wouldn't have predicted gurren lagaan tackling in this universe or at least during the timespan covered in the show there has never been a reasonable amount of time for a substantial society to take root and grow there were always little underground communities with their own customs but only after the defeat of a lord genome where the characters finally able to settle into a city that contained hundreds of thousands of people's it's important to keep in mind that this is a society full of people that have not experienced society from top to bottom and that this is a world in which fighting spirit can achieve virtually anything so these two facts alone have an influence on the merits or lack thereof of any political power moves made by the government as explained through the story there was a predictable honeymoon period where everything was running smoothly for the government and people in gurren lagaan but things always go so well until they don't and by the 7-year time skips people were becoming restless and unhappy doubting that this relatively new civilization was right for them and upset with those in power this was nothing too different regular exasperated water cooler talk and routine grumblings that happen everyday in our world but for these people it was a new dynamic in turn this put pressure on semen and Roz you two men who were unaccustomed to dealing with this kind of unique issue and who were also under strain from Lourdes genomes Proclamation that humanity would be doomed once the population reached 1 million semen was always someone who acted with his heart but this contrasted the colder and more calculating ross you as someone who is not used to or suited to political leadership see mold struggles to come to grips with maintaining order while abiding to his morals this put the emphasis on raw co2 do things his way and after Seymour's conflict with the anti spiral layed ruin to the city the public had grown very unhappy causing Ross you to realize that he must do something to maintain order this is why he took someone who was not a public darling by any means semen and turned him into a scapegoat he hoped that this move would restore a relative calm to the masses allowing him to deal with the situation at hand he felt like he had to arrest and sentence his friend to death because he felt like it was the thing that would benefit society most as a whole and he was completely alone in this decision with no one to look to as a role model in a similar situation ironically except for the memories of the chief man of the village of a died due to a complete lack of exposure to be societal situations in the past Rossi you panicked and made a knee-jerk decision which he personally was against and this decision ended up being the wrong one the funny thing is that it was a political move that I honestly think would have made some sort of sense in our cynical world but in gurren lagaan 'he's insane universe it ended up making a fool out of Roz you in a world like ours this would be an undesirable and cruel yet intelligent play a display of utilitarian ethics that not many would argue would have an overall positive effect on the city's sociological state but in gurren lagaan where you have things like spiral power the improbable is possible and it is actually a logical thing to go for broke and try to save everyone in everything and this is what Ross you didn't understand and he was a realist living in an idealist world sort of a mirror image of idealist living in brutal settings that we see in other works of fiction you know that character from that story that you loved whose ideals were unrealistically positive and not fit for the rigid world they lived in think of Roth you as the opposite of that kind of character so due to the fact that this society was a completely new thing for everyone and that it existed in a world with looser boundaries of reality than ours seeing the way that the post time-skip city function was truly fascinating to me it was a study of how tiny variable alterations can change the way we view how society should be run and some excellent character moments were brought to the fore thanks to this it was a very mature and cerebral trajectory that the story went in here and not a direction that I foresaw the show going in in the beginning but it is a direction that I am so glad that it went in because it really added layers and a new element to the narrative that I really appreciated gurren lagaan while far from perfect was an anime that I wholeheartedly enjoys from start to finish as soon as I realized that I had to suspend my disbelief it's a heartfelt story that isn't afraid to exaggerate the point that tries to make through pure narrative insanity and I really admire that but what I dug most out of it were the aforementioned themes based on some very intricate topics yes the 27 episodes were full of giant robots beating the out of each other ridiculous attack names fanservice jiggle physics and some great story beats that basically demanded that The Watcher stand up for what they believe in no matter what trials they faced but put that aspects of gurren lagaan to the side for a moment and you'll discover some very interesting sauce food about coping with death self growth discoveries and the nuances of socio politics simply put there is substance to gurren lagaan and like I said in the beginning downplaying the depth is doing a disservice to this anime these themes were ones that I would never have predicted the show fixating on from the start but ones that really fit the narrative as the story organically headed in a direction in which these issues would become relevant thanks so much for watching and listening to my take on gurren lagaan and a special thanks in particular to the ones who constantly recommended that I watch it it really was a great time if you like this video and want to see more like it consider supporting the channel by giving this video a like subscribing or even supporting me on patreon other than that you can always follow me on Twitter or add me on my enemy list which are two platforms that I'm very active on be sure to let me know what you thought about this anime in the comments and I'll catch you guys later [Music],Aleczandxr
_h3VbNK-uRw,The_Duality_of_Gurren_Lagann," A big concept that's tackled throughout Gurren Lagann is oppression. From the minute examples of it in the small underground villages throughout the world that we witness in the introductory episodes, to the universe wide adversity that the anti-spirals represent, humanity is constantly being subjugated. The nature of this need to control humanity may have seem justified to those in power, but regardless of the reasoning behind these acts, oppression, and the consequences of it, are an ever-present element in the story, both during, and in generations prior to the timespan of the show. Predictably, this has led to an effect on the inhabitants of the world, and the constant beating down of mankind has trained human beings to accept, and succumb to their situation. Over time, people have acquired a learned helplessness, and there's very little encouragement for the notion of making a life for oneself, apart from menial tasks and misplaced worship. As a result of this, we have a very palpable sense of the characters in this story - quote-unquote - ""playing their roles"" due to either cowardice, or for the good of their fellow men. Of course, the people doing this might not necessarily agree with the behaviours that they promote, but they're just doing what they've learned is the only way to live. And this can lead to a relatability and a depth of character in this story, due to a duality founded from the dissonance between the outward masks that people in this story put on to play their roles, and what they truly feel. But this dualistic nature is not strictly limited to negative implications, and if it were, then the story would feel much less optimistic than it ended up being. There's a flipside to so many characters in Gurren Lagann, an inner depth or ulterior motive, that not only adds to but defines who these people are. The more somber examples of people who feel helpless but play their roles contribute to the audience's perception of how tyrannical a setting this is. While the more positive characters break the mold and spit in the faces of the doubters through their inner motivations, which form the thematic and emotional foundation for the story. Regardless of context, Gurren Lagann is absolutely filled with deep characterization, and a lot of that is because of the contrast and duality between what the characters act like, and how they truly feel. There are at least two levels of characterization to the majority of characters in this series: The deceiving surface level, consisting of the outward behaviors of our characters, and the deeper second layer, consisting of the true reason behind those behaviors. And this second layer is everything in Gurren Lagann. Those in power in Gurren Lagann are justifiably viewed as tyrants by the limited perspective of the main characters The anti-spirals are vilified by the cast for their beatdown of spiral beings, Lord Genome is literally treated as a villain for the first half of the show for his and his beastmen's destructive methods, and the Village Elders are spotlighted as overly paranoid, eccentric, and perhaps even insane chiefmen by Kamina and others for their unorthodox, and seemingly needless, preoccupation with keeping village populations down and restricting people to underground. But what becomes clear is that these oppressors are playing these roles that have been thrust onto them, not because they want to, but because they feel like they have to. And this is due mainly to the learned helplessness that I talked about earlier. Gurren Lagann is toted as a silly and crazy fun series, and it is, but I think that the darkness of the setting is overlooked at times. If you had been taught your whole life by people who had been taught by others their whole life, that there is no way for mankind to rise in prominence in the world, Then you would believe it, and regard that fact with as much esteem as the fact that water is wet. Those in power may seem personally authoritarian on the surface, But they are simply playing the roles given to them that are needed to ensure that humans don't become extinct entirely. Because they harbor no hope that there is another way. In particular, the anti spirals, who are the most antagonistic group in the series, are given an extra dimension here. They were oppressive and fundamentally backwards in their ideals, but had a point that humanity would eat itself if this setting were to keep progressing, as illustrated with how Rossiu spun the government out of control. They justifiably worked to suppress spiral power to prevent the spiral nemesis, but failed to realize that spiral power itself was the most precious asset that humanity had. From the universe wide rule of the anti-spirals, to the minor leadership of the village chiefs, these people are simply doing what they must, even if they aren't necessarily seeing the bigger picture. In many cases, I'm sure there was internal agony on the part of the leaders, who had to commit atrocious acts to preserve their race, but it must be stressed that the essence of these people is rooted in a pure care for man. The way this concept applies to these characters is one of the more obvious instances of the second layer in the plot, but it's one of the most powerful. And it really is thematically essential to the story, because it drives home the very metaphorical nature of the narrative through the point that the closest thing to a villain in Gurren Lagann is the idea that you can't achieve the seemingly impossible. For the sake of redundancy, I won't spend as much time on Rossiu as I did in my other video, but it must be said that his second layer truly makes him the bridge between the watcher, and the other oppressors. His actions of limiting the growth of the human race, and sentencing Simon to death for the sake of order and prosperity, were completely despicable and tragically misled. But Episode 23 adds a much needed dimension to Rossiu. Through it, we see that not only was he doing all of this for what he perceived as humanity's benefit, but that it pained him to his absolute core. On the surface, Rossiu was a power-hungry tyrant who betrayed his friend in cold blood, but when we're given a deeper look, we see that he was completely selfless in his motives, as narrow minded as they ended up being. Of course this doesn't forgive his actions, but it gives him the potential as a character to make strides to redeem himself, in the ways that he intended all along. And he gladly takes that route, showing his true colors in the end. Without the emotional context of Rossiu's arc, the internal struggles or motivations that take place within Lord Genome, the anti-spirals, and the village leaders, would feel somewhat alien and detached. We would have been able to understand the situations, thanks to some lines that we get from the characters, but not truly grasp the pain that some of them went through in playing their unwanted roles. But thanks to the psychological turmoil that Rossiu went through in naively trying to better humanity through his methods, we can truly sympathize with these characters, and their motivations become a much more personal and comprehensible concept. Rossiu gave us an inside look at the people that tried to maintain this world through stagnation, and this gives an element of dynamism and maturity to the series that really went a long way. Yoko is deceptive, especially to people who know about her but have never watched the show. On the absolute shallowest level, you could define Yoko as a kick-ass fanservice machine who is just tough, independent, no-nonsense, and needs no one. But if you've watched the show, then you'd very quickly correct this presumption. Yoko sometimes acts as though she doesn't crave the attention or affection of others, but this is a paper-thin wall to break down before Yoko's true essence shines. She is very obviously someone who cares for people, and values close connections, displayed through her feelings for Kamina, her adoration of Simon, her maternal nature that comes out near the end, her fantasy-induced dream involving Kittan, anything really. Having said that, Yoko's dualism mainly comes from her narrative role rather than her characterization. On the surface, Yoko adds personality and sex appeal to the story, but she's very much a character of strength, who provides balance, and whose themes are communicated through. She's pretty intelligent and mature, willing to take action like Kamina, but only after thinking about whether or not the action is logical or beneficial, like early Simon or Rossiu, which balances out these characters who would seem like polar opposites. And while Simone was hit incredibly hard by Kamina's death, Yoko showed true maturity in the way that she dealt with it. She is a character who is constantly left in tragic positions, having two potentially romantic partners stolen from her shortly after professing their feelings for her, and through this we are given clear examples of the darker and somber themes in Gurren Lagann, of the sheer necessity of adapting from tragedy and persevering. I can't stress how self-assured Yoko is. She's able to pick herself up after being left face down in the dust, she's able to come to terms with, and move on from her suffering alone, and most notably, she's able to understand her role in this world before anyone else really does. Her ability to realize that she had no desired place in modern civilization was when the Simon would eventually come to later in life, but one that she discovered years and years earlier. She provides an example for a type of person that humanity needs if it wants to flourish. Despite how larger-than-life she is, at the end of the day, she decided to stand aside, provide a supportive role, and nurture the young minds of the future in order to stand the world in good stead. She represents a good portion of the realism in the story, which all contributes to my perception of her as a dualistic balancing tool in the story. To me, Yoko is an absolutely ideal support character, and a terrific personification of Gurren Lagann as a series: Fun, badass, and sexy, but incredibly mature at the same time. Kamina is everything in Gurren Lagann. He drove the narrative forward in the first act, planted the seed of determination in the protagonist that enabled them to make their stand at the end, and shaped the tonal structure and narrative trajectory of the story, through how his death impacted the plot. Without Kamina, big themes in Gurren Lagann based on unyielding determination would seem shallow, and maybe even immaterial. And this was all achieved by his characterization, which was so boldly, yet intricately, done that I considered what Gurren Lagann did with him in only eight episodes to be something of a masterstroke. His surface-level characterization is a lot of what people tend to dislike him for. Kamina is cocky, hot-blooded, determined, and optimistic to the point of foolishness. I can completely understand why he might seem irritating to some, due to his tendency to act on impulse, and his inclination to stupidly charge into battles that seem unwinnable. On this level, Kamina is very much a burly, sunglass-wearing representation of Gurren Lagann themes of perseverance and self-confidence, and this impression takes up a great percentage of his lasting impact, but when we look a bit deeper, we can see that this outward behavior is not simply a result of true self confidence, or defiance to authority. It's much more. When he was a young boy, Kamina's father somehow reached the surface. He asked Kamina to come with him, but Kamina's fear of the unknown awaiting him in this new and foreign land meant that he didn't have the courage to follow. Instead of going on together, the two promised each other that they'd meet again someday. This promise, along with the inspiration of his father and what he represents, is a huge driving force behind Kamina's actions. He doesn't break through the surface just because he wants to defy authority, he does it because he wants to both fulfil his promise to his father, and believe in his father's hope that there was a prosperous world out there. And after Kamina discovers that his father has died, his warring against the Beastmen was, again, not founded in simple rivalry or blind determination like it may seem, but in an ambition of providing humanity with a world that they didn't have to be afraid of, one that his father desired. Kamina truly cares for people, and expresses this care through protecting them and providing inspiration for them to do their best through his charisma. But the truth is, his ramblings, confidence, and charismatic actions, are a simple front to cover up and compensate for the fact that he has insecurities and worries. In the past, Kamina and Simon's in the village had been caved in. Kamina did his usual thing by keeping everyone positive through his words, but it was Simon who was the true hero, by continuously drilling through the rock to get everyone out. Moments like this inspired Kamina to never give up or show fear, and whenever he felt down, he remembered Simon's determination. To Kamina, the people like Simon are the real heroes. He gives them motivation and confidence, but they carry it through. Simon would not have been able to live without Kamina, but Kamina is truly telling the truth when he says that it's the other way around as well. They complete each other. And Kamina acknowledges this, using it to inspire others, so that they can keep pushing when they may be lacking the confidence to do so. It's a very interesting, and pretty touching sort of self-fulfilling prophecy at work here. While it may seem like Kamina being as inspirational as he was was just a happy coincidence, the fact is that he is much more intelligent than people give him credit for. He knows the importance of his role, and he embellishes it. But he's very acutely aware that he is playing this role to motivate others, and that without others, he would be alone and afraid. Kamina's deeper characterization can be easy to miss when looking at the broad picture of the story, but isolate him and his actions, and we see that he is intentionally everything that he needs to be to support his friends, in order to make up for his deficiencies. He wasn't just an angelic or ideological martyr, he was a flawed human being, who grew and developed, and taught others how to grow and develop, and that is a huge distinction that I think has to be made when it comes to Kamina. Nia finds herself to be the outlier in this story in basically as many ways as one can be distinguished in an anime. She has no knowledge of the dynamics of the ongoing conflict, she's the only character who didn't know Kamina, she even starkly stands out in terms of color scheme and character design. But most importantly, she's one of the only characters in this story without a dualistic nature. Nia is also the only primary character in the story that speaks exactly what's on her mind, all the time. She is completely transparent, and although saying that she had a horrible childhood is a massive understatement, she hasn't been conditioned in any way to hide her feelings. I definitely would have bought it if she hid herself from the world, as the way she was discarded by Lord Genome could easily leave emotional scars. But you can always tell what's going on in Nia's head. Early story Simon, Viral, Kamina, Yoko, all of the oppressors, Rossiu, they all had internal feelings to one degree or another, that tended to hide behind outward behaviors. But Nia is the opposite. Just observe the way that people around Nia act in shock and awe when she speaks her mind. She says the things that people tend to think, but are afraid to say, and she speaks exactly how she's feeling. Her introduction into the story is a welcome breath of fresh air to lighten up the bleakness of the tone after Kamina's death, and this is achieved, in part, thanks to her lack of duality, which contrasts with so much of the rest of the show, and helps her to stand out. Viral is one of the best examples throughout the story of the two levels of characterization. Although his two levels are both pretty apparent from almost the offset, and the lines between the two layers become so blurred by the end that they're indistinguishable. Similarly to the way that humans across generations were conditioned to believe that mankind would never be able to live out of the shadows, Viral has spent his entire life being told that humans are primitive, naked, ape scum. This much was clear from the beginning, But as soon as he comes into contact with humans for the first time, he begins to question things. Underneath the outward aggression, Viral secretly admires the tenacity and honesty of humans, and his surprisingly strong sense of honour distinguishes him from the common beastmen rabble. His thoughts stray into some existentialist territory as he wonders what the reason behind his purpose is, and he simultaneously begins weakening his irrational hatred for humanity, feeling a strange sort of emptiness upon hearing that Kamina has died. As the series progresses, Viral's outward role of being a humanity-hating beastman wanes, until he decides to join Team Dai Gurren. And here we see the rawest, truest essence of Viral. He was a man that was born into a loveless group, that just wants simple human connection that he had been starved of. He acts rough and disconnected on the exterior, but it is clearer than ever that Viral thrives from being part of a group that loves and supports one another. United against a common cause. Here he is experiencing all of the emotional connections that he has subconsciously been jealous of, and it all comes together in episode 26, when we are shown the team's truest desires. I couldn't help but get chills in seeing that above all, what Viral wanted most was family. Of course, he dismisses this as a sappy dream, and rejoins the fray immediately, but that doesn't eliminate what his base desires are. From the start, the two layers of the Viral, the first one being his irrational detestment of mankind, and the second being his more questioning and sentimental nature, are segregated. But as his baseless hate for humanity diminishes, the two begin to merge as he questions the role of the Beastmen and his own existence. His deeper layer takes prominence as he joins Team Dai Gurren, completing a very interesting character arc. And his ability to accept the romanticized reality of a fictional wife and daughter as pure fantasy, was a deceivingly important element of the story. Themes involved with being able to accept the limitations of reality may seem paradoxical in a story like Gurren Lagann, but believe me when I say that it is as significant of a narrative message as nearly everything else. Aside from the characters, Gurren Lagann is also completely rooted in dualism when it comes to its final messages with the series, where we find that the encouraging mantra of the story related to limitless personal potential, is actually contrasted by the fact that death is a natural part of life. In an ending that is proven to be pretty controversial, Simon decides to forego the option to keep Nia alive. This ending is deemed by some to be inappropriate and inconsistent with the tone and messages of the series, but in examining the true essence of Gurren Lagann's depth this couldn't be farther from the truth. Simon is aware of the anti-spiral's message, the warning that uninhibited progress for the human race would spell ruin, so he does not use spiral power to save Nia, because he's mature enough to realize the balance that the race must adhere to, and this maturity has been an underlying element of the story all along. In the end, Gurren Lagann preaches that life should be full of vibrant adventures, and sticking it to the man, and not letting yourself be oppressed. But it also preaches that life is finite, that death is an inevitability, and a natural thing that we must all become used to. We saw Simon adapt to death throughout his character arc, and we see him use all that he's learned in the end to resist the temptation of bringing loved ones back. In one way, Simon has learned to laugh in the face of adversity, but in another, he has accepted the fragility of life. In contrasting the message celebrating how great it is to live life with reckless abandon, in its final scenes, Gurren Lagann is also very much a Memento Mori, a reminder that, in the end, we must accept our mortality. That we can progress and strive for more, but not be unrealistic, and we should not fear this, but instead embrace it. and seize the fleeting moments of life that we have. When it comes to characters, themes, and the essence of the entire narrative itself, Gurren Lagann is all about this duality. The show finds a lot of its identity in its bombastic, colorful, and hot-blooded first layer, but is all the more substantial for the depth provided through its character focused, motivation driven, and mature second layer. The strengths of each layer are accentuated by the other, and each is made more influential due to the other's presence. I think that this is what I take from the narrative structure of Gurren Lagann the most, and why it sticks in the minds and hearts of so many who experience the story. This is definitely not a unique concept, and I'm not praising Gurren Lagann for simply implementing it. In fact, I've talked about this idea in several of my videos in the past, with regards to other stories. But the setting-based chain effect that led to the dualistic nature of this story's characters, and the way that this depth satisfyingly contributed to the series resolution, really made it stand out to me, and is yet another example of how Gurren Lagann is actually much less one-dimensional than people tend to give it credit for. Thanks for taking the time to watch this video, and I sincerely hope that you enjoyed.",Aleczandxr
kBkTITnQqF4,What_is_a_Leader_Gurren_Lagann_Anime_Discussion, it's now been seven years how far has human civilization advanced and progressed in such a short time you are exactly like kamina was in the old days have you learned nothing from his death you haven't grown at all so doing nothing is what you need to do huh now you're finally the same as the spiral king [Music] act three of guren lagan is a different beast from the prior two it opens not on giant robots slugging each other to and fro in bombastic action but on paperwork and delegation kamina is memorialized in grand fashion the city they establish is bustling and moving along at record pace and everyone is experiencing a new combination for the first time peace and freedom at once but under the surface there are dissatisfied rumblings as lord genome's final words spur rossio on to defy orders from the now supreme commander of simone team daigoran are all now heads of government offices but they bicker and squabble with their leadership stumbling barely through their duties and as the population hits one million their peace is shattered their freedom threatened and their anger at an all-time high with the arrival of the anti-spiral just as it seemed they'd reach the calm stasis of these sort of lives we all live chaos returned once again but was that kind of stasis they found exactly why everything went so wrong first we discussed how kamina led them to the surface and by covering his own weakness spurred them to action then we looked at this fall the reaction and what they could all learn from it and now we see that the lesson was nowhere near complete it's time for us not to analyze a form of leadership not its pros and cons but instead to look at a broader horizon what even is leadership supposed to be i think that's the question guern logan asks of its main cast in the final arc delaying the most critical aspect for last in a way almost sadly fitting for the real world too often we learn that from the very start we were looking at the question all wrong or sometimes not even realizing that there was a question to be asked i think the best place to start this discussion is with the anti-spiral the enemy who seemingly tries to destroy but may have actually accidentally saved our heroes either way they perform that action by being the exact opposite of what leadership is their goal is the opposite of the hope communists stood for as they seek to inflict ultimate despair upon the spiral races the reasoning is that ultimate despair is the only way to break the endless spirit of spiral races a spirit which may lead to the destruction of the universe evolution leads these species to branch out in mild and erratic paths to fight anything that stands in their way as they seek to grow and advance it happens at a rapid pace in only seven years humanity was able to set up mass production of the graw pearls raise an entire city from the ground up and develop most of the systems and technology familiar to us it's just about unthinkably quick giving credence to the fears of the anti-spiral with this unhinged advancement branching out in any and every direction they see it possible that unchecked spiral power could destroy the physical laws of the world and lead to the end of everything so they simply stopped progressing at all their homeworld is a series of once fire life forms locked in a repeating pattern all having given themselves over to eternal stasis seeking to wipe out any and all who threaten the continuance of that stasis through spiral power they're entirely hung up on what comment i will later call a what if a future that doesn't exist but seemingly might eventually this fear of the what-if is the driving force of the anti-spiral's entire being rather than risk the small potential of losing everything through unchecked evolution they took the only guaranteed safe option to never advance or change again to prevent one future they feared they wiped out every possible future that could be we can see their focus on potential futures by one of the final efforts they have to stall teen daguran they locked all the conscious beings with spiral power into an endless loop of potentials they lived out fantasies which never happened on earth it's the other end of things showing everything that could be good but it's the same idea an endless attraction from one reality this is the raw power of what if making them so caught up in what could be they simply forgot the agency of their lives the same as the anti-spotter that quashing of the evolutionary force the desire to branch out in erratic paths and create an unknown future is the opposite of what leadership should be but i still say the anti-spiral may have saved them because those invaders weren't the only ones who exhibited this behavior a focus on what if is the same way rossio leads and the same reason why the people riot rossiu governs based on the worst what if from his days in adai village in his time ruling over the world the idea is the same sacrifice whatever it takes for the guaranteed option sacrifice for survival his village elder maintained the brutal lottery to ensure there would be enough food to maintain but never to grow as a leader rossio decides that instead of fighting they take the guaranteed option which ends up being a sacrifice of 82 percent of the population before being revealed to have been a pointless endeavor altogether it isn't an easy decision as he rightfully explains to kitan if we fail humanity truly will go extinct tell me are you able to bear that responsibility when you look at the worst case of each side it can make sense flea and humanity will always have the chance to rebuild fight and it may be entirely wiped out but where he's like the anti-spiral is looking only at the worst of each option you can also look at it another way look at what's being lost not what's being possibly saved flee in your sacrificing a majority of the population fight and you can save all of it this is the same thing coming a feuded with the village elder over i'll literally play the audio from how i described it in our first video on this topic this mindset of all or nothing is the cornerstone of the wonderful episode 5 as well he hates the chief is willing to take 10 or so rather than fighting for 100 in communist minds it's more worthwhile to risk that small percent for a huge increase rather than just try and sustain what's almost nothing to be fair rossio isn't a bad leader but simply one who was bad for this situation in times of peace the hard decisions aren't made in numbers of lies but in the mitigation of daily costs it's establishing services in the right locations to best meet need making supply lines to adequately feed population centers and all of that is managing limited resources these are all things that require the kind of touch he has that say kamina would have never had and like everyone else he learned from kamina part of what gives him the potential to be a good leader comes from this he explains human impulses catch fire and spread in the blink of an eye someone must be made to take responsibility this act recognizing this and placing the blame on a common enemy is exactly what kamina did first feeding those emotions through himself to create a legend simone improved on this by cutting himself out of the equation a bit more allowing everyone to recognize their own roles in fighting the enemy or at least those who were close to him rossio learned what kind of society emerged from those two before him and played to it but once again he does so out of fear he sees their emotions as something dangerous not to be destroyed like the anti-spiral but rather something which must be controlled and that brings us to recognize that in another way he didn't learn from kamina because he makes some of the same mistakes he keeps the reality of his situation in the shadows both the personal cost and his weakness as well as the very direction he's taking humanity in if it was up to him they never would have learned about the destruction of earth as they did when everyone was panicking i was yelling internally just tell them that you have a plan but that wouldn't be the most effective way to manipulate their emotions into support and continuing on with communist mistakes once he finally reveals the plan to save them all he does so by himself taking the credit and becoming the next idol of hope same as communion would have he's playing a game of numbers with the incalculability of human emotions trying to adapt his strategy to the society that simone and comedy left behind and it doesn't work and we can address why they riot as well as the false and seymoud's leadership from which we can find the meaning of leadership as we said the riots are another case of the what-ifs only this time as they look to the best-case scenario they're angry at losing the lives they would have never even dreamed about only a few years prior described in this exchange between racio and simone it's all self-centered nonsense they've completely forgotten what life was like in the pits i think that's great is it though but this is a direct result of the way simon led them when he took over for coming out and when he began to lead the new world simone didn't understand what leadership meant he simply understood what comet did and then how to improve on it all they had was a winning formula for the times they were in not for leadership in general what the pair did was collect the bottled up energy of the human race and unleash it on a common point in their case lord genome they burst out from beneath the surface with this pent-up desire for freedom and saw it through but all they ever knew had to do was direct energy in a foe and so that's all their followers knew how to do as well it was a form of leadership not the concept as a whole with this they were never ready to become true leaders but they did anyway because they always did the hard work for everyone else they just kept doing what they always did once teplin had fallen that energy that facilitated the victory didn't fade away humanity will always have that drive into the unknown it's just instead of being directed to something meaningful it was allowed to fester and stew to become selfish and negative because it was going anywhere and nowhere all at once don't get me wrong i hate these citizens i almost didn't want to cover this arc because the reaction eats at me from the inside because it's so stupid but i understand why it's so stupid it was a failure of leadership people weren't working to a better future they were left to their own devices in a world with new unbounded pleasures they were experiencing for the first time it drove them to plant hedonism the only way they'd ever come together was in a collective hatred rossio understood that and made the decision to act on where it was directed ordering the death of one of his closest allies a sacrifice for survival emerging directly from simone in communist world all of this is the collection of their leadership and its failures and these failures are what led raw suits become loathsome like the citizens as well he's arrogant and cocky as he takes over partially because he knows the importance of a strong face from kamino but also because he witnessed how awful everyone was at their jobs he can only think himself to be the perfect leader because he's witnessing awful leadership from his perspective he may as well be infinitely better than them not quite a failure of simone but more so a lesson of why good leadership is so important because only through it can the next leaders have any hope of improving in the right ways me and the fellas just don't fit in with all this government stuff ross you we're just team gurin you sure you haven't mistaken me for someone else i'm just miss yomiko an ordinary new school teacher it's in your hands now rossiou but simone i'm just simone the digger i've been saying the word direction a lot and that's because it's at the core of our idea of what leadership is a concept we can now tackle the human spirit is erratic and illogical it spurs out from its starting point in incalculable directions branching off in paths we could have never imagined it would take it's forceful and subtle all at once a mixture of soft feelings motivating grand actions it's always there always acting and driving us forward into a future we know absolutely nothing about left to its own devices it is dangerous in that way it leads to endless sources of inspiration but also infinite despair the anti-spirals were once spiral life forms like anything else their emotional drive led them to what they are now this illogical and boundless nature is a guarantee of the universe so the role of a leader is to direct those feelings to something meaningful and beneficial it's to remind people of the importance of that direction to prevent them from getting lost in the what-ifs and keep them on a path which leads to a good future with that in mind kamino was a good leader for his time he directed that energy to a beneficial future through himself simone was as well by improving on that formula by not putting it through himself but then it falls apart when there's no enemy they'd reach the surface now able to gaze up at every star with complete wonder and a complete lack of direction it sounds odd but the next step is to narrow that vision not to the same point for everyone not out of control or fear but out of love to clear a pathway to positive futures and block off the pathways to negative ones if they want to make mistakes they must be allowed to but a leader should try their best to steer them gently from such things it's a mitigation like what racio choose but with the respect for humanity he lacked lives can be looked at as a game of numbers sometimes hard decisions have to be made but there reaches a point where those decisions discard the very fabric of humanity like being locked in a spaceship for years the same as a pit underground knowing you only exist because so many others died so it's absolutely perfect that when racial learns this lesson he finally says that he wants to feel the weight of a single human life there needs to be a lot of emphasis on how kamina explains this to simone in his return he says just don't be distracted by the what-ifs should'ves and if onlys the one thing you choose yourself that is the truth of your universe and that choice is very important that's all kamina was ever really doing he was trying to grasp the future he wanted it just so happened it was good for everyone else too and that he fought at the right time and with the right people and against the right people to turn it into a movement but it was simply his desire when humanity reached the surface it was good for them but it wasn't a future they chose simply the one chosen for them because of that everything was really done for them someone else had always fought the battles and they didn't expect that to change another reason why they act so selfishly there's a big difference between being fought for and being led and that reaction they have is exactly it i think this idea of choice is really shown best through kitan though when he makes the decision to sacrifice himself it's for the future he thinks should exist one where his family can live in peace on the surface it may help everyone but at the end of the day it's simply his desire that he's taking into his own hands as he explained to give me indari and his yoko later repeats to him you're doing this because you want to i can't stop you while these circumstances require to cost that no one should ever have to pay for the future they want was based on exactly the kind of inspiration a leader should provide i say his decision was a selfishly motivated one that simply happened to benefit humanity because that's exactly what a leader should narrow the possibilities down to the most we can ask of anyone is to act selfishly in a positive way true leaders give everyone the chance to chase their own desires in a way that doesn't negatively impact the world and ideally benefits it it's a suggestion a nudge in the right direction that helps illuminate the path to a future which is more than certainly not a positive one guided but not forced it's what he chose to chase with a burning passion coming over turning to inspire them here is much more appropriate than him simply being their lost comrade as well his return here is the final note on the idea of legends we looked at how positive firstly they could be and later how negatively as well and this is one last reminder that they have their time in place like anything else coming it was hope an idol of freedom in their darkest moments he was a miracle when it was needed a well of nonsensical statements and actions that could be meaningful to anyone and everyone because there were so many because they only meant what people themselves personally gave to them faced with ultimate despair this is the kind of leadership they need the kind which is bullheaded and brute and directed against a genuine evil kamina can return successfully here because it was his time and place too it's the same as why rasu stays on earth for this fight because his time isn't war simone's is and that's the final part of the lesson which leads us through the resolution once the fight is over and humanity is saved once nia disappears and the future is once again open to the entire sky of stars simone leaves because his time has ended he's not the leader this new peaceful world needs he learned everything we covered here and he fought for a world where he would be obsolete he explains it as well as the loss of their comrades who walk the same path as him like this those who are dead are dead if we bring them back to life they'll just get in the way of the next generation right there's someone better suited to go down the tunnels i dug and this same sentiment is displayed when rocio learns the faults of his leadership discussing how things change over time you eventually learn that something you thought was a precious treasure is nothing but junk i wonder if that qualifies as evolution progress means leaving things no longer needed behind you can't move forward if the path in front of you is completely crowded further this is also a correction of communist mistakes it is genuinely sad to see the greatest hero the world will ever see fade off into obscurity as simone does but it's what he needed to do if he stuck around it became a symbol a comedy did a constant reminder worshiped in stone before all would have only taken them down the same flawed path they once tried simone rejects the brand that he and kamena became and instead allows the world to focus on a legend which is more positive not the pilots of garand logan but guerin logan itself something that many people have piloted at the end of the day anyone could be in something people can aspire to be for many reasons i generally love this line as one to finish off the series the kid who says look at all those current logins because it puts everything very nicely an emphasis on gurren lagan itself the symbol of hope not as one thing but as many a direction for their energy and their hope guidance but to whichever one they choose as their future to any star they want in the sky and each one climbs higher towards those stars no matter which one is picked that kind of direction is exactly what a leader is supposed to instill in people we have almost a microcosm of all of this in yoko as well in one dedicated episode she conveniently embodies everything we just covered here with her students when her new student knock him needs to get back up she doesn't offer a hand but rather encouragement for him to do it himself you can get up by yourself can't you she knows the mistakes they made in fighting for everyone else and the negative outcomes it would lead to if things are dire enough that she needs to step in she will as she does later but these small moments are where we can show people how to help themselves not how to be helped similarly when she does jump to hakeem's rescue when he genuinely needs help she offers some words of inspiration saying i saw a view like this once before i was with a boy who was a lot like you like me we know this is the hero of the world but he doesn't and i like that she's placing the importance of what simon did not on him exactly but rather on how he changed in what it meant it keeps things away from the excessive personality focus that these cities shows and onto what matters guiding this child to some better ideas and here she really is like a leader one who avoids more of kaminat and simon's pitfalls first of all she adapted it was obvious they were all misfits in government's roles and she wouldn't have been any better so she left to adapt to the situation and continue to do something meaningful not just a meek continuation of what she did before and she removes herself from the grand stage that they fought on fully aware that the leaders who work in everyday situations are just as important as those who lead the world the latter is only possible because the former hold everything together at the base level after all as a teacher she's able to pass these lessons on to the next generation helping to ensure that great leadership will continue on naturally when the antsy spirals appear it's a situation where a warrior is needed over a teacher and this is something she was just as ready for with a simple smack she's back into form ready to fight for the world once again this is some supreme recognition that just as the world wants change to peace it can change to anything at any time the best thing she can do for her kids now isn't a lecture but the safety of a swift victory so she slips right back into it different times call for different leaders where everyone else learned a part of these lessons one or two at a time she figured them all out they were all waiting for another war she was adapting to try and prevent the next one and i think kyoko is the most fitting note to end on as a reminder that leadership isn't always something grand it has the same goal but it doesn't have to change the universe every time a world is just a collection of people all playing out their parts the same as everyone else team dagarin wasn't just kamina it wasn't just simone it wasn't just yoko it was everyone just because someone was at the helm doesn't make them any more important they couldn't exist without everyone else who was following behind them a leader only has power as long as they are followed it was their decision to fight for the future they wanted to put their faith in someone else who saw the same thing it was just that the situation one entirely unknown to them led to so many pitfalls they never needed this new world kind of leadership before and the fact that they worked all of these lessons out in such a few tries is almost amazing really and hopefully i've been able to do some justice by those ideas that gur and logan presented here and help expand on all of your ideas of leadership as well through across these now three videos i honestly forgot how amazing this series was and how it managed to accomplish both a very deep and meaningful message which this is only one of a few in there and also some of the most downright ridiculous and insane action of all time but like leaders that topic has a time in place that isn't right here right now so let me know if that more of a technical analysis of gurren lagan and trying to figure out why it is so good uh and so deep is something you'd like to see as well and a good way to do that which in full transparency also really helps with the algorithm is to leave a like or a comment on this video uh if you if i missed anything if there's anything you want to add or another topic you'd like to see me cover that those are all good things for comments uh which again very good for the algorithm and everything but i do appreciate them because they let me know what you thought of the video if it was good if it was bad if i missed anything and as well as being a motivation for me it also adds a bit more perspective to get your ideas and see if i'm really making the things you want me to and have the level of depth depth in my comment that you've come to appreciate from it anyway i'm getting very long-winded at the end here so i'll just leave you with a few links in the pinned comment i'll have my twitter where you can follow me stay up to date and see random thoughts at like one in the morning uh my twitch where we stream sometimes on thursday nights and saturday afternoons depending on how busy i am the discord where we hang out have a few chats and some different things like that and most importantly my patreon where you can get your name at the other videos like these lovely people above me right now if we can get just a few more people over there we'll start doing some additional benefits as well but anyway thank you for watching and i hope i'll see you again soon,ProfessorViral
