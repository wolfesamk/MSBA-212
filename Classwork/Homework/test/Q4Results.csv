Ugw_47QOA16LnmLB-a54AaABAg,@keybladesrus,"Gurren Lagann is one of my favorite anime of all time. Recently, I watched all of Eva. The show, EoE, and the Rebuild movies. I was excited to do so because, on paper, Eva has so much that I should love in an anime. I wanted to see why it&#39;s so highly acclaimed, and thought I would love it. I HATED Eva. I lack the words and critical analysis skills to fully explain why, but I hated it so much. I only kept going because I needed to see why it was so loved. Surely something would happen at some point that would make it all click, and I would get it. That never happened, and by the end, I was just glad that it was over. <br><br>Throughout Eva, I kept thinking about Gurren Lagann and how both series kept touching on similar points, but I felt Gurren Lagann did so better and much more coherently. This video has helped me recognize the different perspectives both series approached the same points from, but my opinion on Eva hasn&#39;t changed at all. I&#39;m not sure why I feel that way. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Eva&#39;s pessimism as opposed to Gurren Lagann&#39;s optimism; the writer of two other favorite anime of mine, Gen Urobuchi, is known to be fatally allergic to happy endings and good vibes. I&#39;m a Kingdom Hearts fan, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the way Eva characters ramble at each other about philosophy and jargon instead of actually talking to each other like human beings. <br><br>I don&#39;t know, nor do I know if I have any point here. In conclusion, Gurren Lagann rocks, and Eva is not for me.",0,0,2023-11-04T14:05:36Z

It shows us how to not be, Misato&#39;s obvious mistakes in being a parent to Shinji (or guardian, whatever, idc), Asuka horrible, horrible emotional control output and the way she treats everyone, Kaji&#39;s forced stuff on Misato, Gendo&#39;s horrible management with grief. Using those bad examples, we should be able to collect our own ways, have our eyes opened, it tells us &quot;do not do that, do NOT be like that&quot; by showing us the consequences, the human instrumentality project in this case.

I truly feel this is both completing and perpetuating a mindset totally contrary to what i believed in before; that despair is inevitable and that absurdity is impossible to overcome.

UgycPDB6WG_rVikyDvN4AaABAg,@luiscortazar6291,"While I really enjoyed your review, I feel as though you mishandled the comparison between Misato and Kamina, and left out Kamina&#39;s polar opposite, Gendo.  <br><br>Throughout the series Misato tries to be nurturing to Shinji, she takes her in, tries to get him to open up and despite her scolding, aims to take care of him and Auska and remind them that they are more than tools. She&#39;s no mother figure, but she&#39;s like a responsible older sister. She and Kamina are different characters, but both try to protect and bring the best out of the two mcs through the laws of their respective universes.<br><br>Gendo which I&#39;m shocked wasn&#39;t mentioned at all, is the worst human being. Someone cold, who treats the people closest to him as tools, and manipulates their feelings for him. When his wife died he abandoned their son, and only called upon him when he saw him as potentially useful. He berates and never showed him any form of support or encouragement. All the negative things you spoke of Misato, they&#39;re more applicable to Gendo. The only person we currently see, that he has any affinity for us Rei. A clone of his wife, who is also the key to his master plan. <br><br>Kamina and Gendo couldn&#39;t be any more different.

And it&#39;s about &quot;tuning the world&quot; to bring harmony, but ends with the protagonist living his dream life as a geeky artist with his girlfriend (I think).

UgzM4QCa3ykDq5AgzUp4AaABAg,@Kidneyjoe42,"I&#39;m not sure how to say this politely, but you more or less entirely misunderstood Evangelion. Eva isn&#39;t about everything being futile or doomed to fall or apart. It&#39;s about hope. Hope in spite of hardship, in spite of misunderstanding and pain. In both the TV ending and EoE, Shinji resolves to keep trying to live and find happiness as an individual human. He acknowledges the difficulties that entails and even concedes that he still hates himself. But he has hope that he can one day learn to love himself and connect with other people and so he&#39;s willing to keep trying. <br>TTGL isn&#39;t a refutation of Evangelion, they have almost exactly the same message. It&#39;s more of a spiritual successor. The one thing I&#39;d say you got right is the difference in the support the protagonist has. Evangelion is, for the most part, an individual struggle for each of the characters, not just Shinji. A great deal of their suffering is due to them being atomized and alone. And Shinji&#39;s big resolution in the end is largely about not continuing to let his self hatred and the fear that is born from it stand in the way of trying to connect with other people. Gurren Lagann basically starts from this point. Simon has the doubts and low opinion of himself that Shinji retains even through the end of Evangelion. But Simon is more willing to open himself up to and have faith in other people, which is what Shinji was at least trying to do in the end. Simon&#39;s growth isn&#39;t entirely due to external factors. While both Kamina and Nia make it their personal mission to build him up, Simon has to make the first move with both of them. This is especially true with Kamina. Simon only ended up with Kamina because he was willing to take the risk of believing in him when they first tried to escape the village. Shinji did try and connect with others throughout Eva, but the fear of making himself truly vulnerable always held him back. Simon is what would happen if Shinji was able to overcome that. Even the extreme optimism of Gurren Lagann in immediately rewarding Simon&#39;s faith with the best friend anyone could ever ask for is a fitting continuation from Evangelion&#39;s cynical realism. It&#39;s representative of the different perspective granted by hope and faith in yourself and others, of the change from fixating on the negative to celebrating the positive. Both shows are ultimately part of the same journey. <br>Also, as an aside, you take things too literally. The technobabble in Evangelion is every bit as irrelevant as it is in Gurren Lagann. That&#39;s a Gainax thing in general. The specific minutiae of the setting is never actually important and only exists to support the characters&#39; story. Ritsuko babbling off a bunch of nonsense is just handled more seriously because the show itself is more serious in tone. And Shinji choking Asuka in EoE isn&#39;t about him hating her. In that moment Asuka is the only other person on Earth. She is the representative of the &quot;other&quot; in contrast to Shinji&#39;s &quot;self&quot;. Shinji choking her after rejecting instrumentality is demonstrating that merely choosing to keep living and hoping doesn&#39;t magically fix everything instantly. Shinji&#39;s desire to connect with others is still complicated by his bitterness and incompetence at forming healthy relationships. And Asuka caressing Shinji&#39;s cheek followed by her disgusted remark maintain the promise of hope by showing that human connection isn&#39;t beyond reach while still remaining grounded in the reality that a change in outlook isn&#39;t going to stop people from feeling negative things towards you.",2,0,2023-07-08T01:53:32Z

So Kamina did the <i>job</i> of Hero and Leader, essentially &quot;stealing the spotlight&quot; of the whole show until it literally killed him.  &quot;Who the hell do you think I am&quot;, in a way, can be taken to be asking, &quot;Do you <b>really</b> think I&#39;m the <i>Leader?</i>  Do you <b>really</b> think I&#39;m the <i>Main Character?</i>  No, Simon is the Main Character of this show, I&#39;m just his opening act!&quot;  And, thus, he keeps the &quot;seat warm&quot; until Simon is inspired enough to take up that Main Character mantle.<br>Kamina looks at the world through <b>literal</b> rose tinted glasses; but Nia&#39;s eyes are rose colored flowers.  She doesn&#39;t need to <i>wear</i> something extra to change how she sees the world; to her, the world <b>is</b> flowers, it <b>is</b> beautiful and rosy, even in its darkest and bleakest.  So both she and Kamina, each in their own way, inspire Simon to totally fulfill his Leadership and Heroic role in the story.<br>Amd it doesn&#39;t even stop there.  Simon, in turn inspires Kitan to become the &quot;Hero of His Own Story&quot;.  Kitan hijacks the Heroic Sacrifice role for himself, having been inspired by Simon, Kamina, and all the rest.  And that, in turn inspires others, <b>including</b> passing inspiration <i>back</i> to Simon.  Simon no longer sees the world <i>just</i> through rosy glasses, but Kitan&#39;s sacrifice forces him to <i>literally</i> &quot;look to the stars&quot; as he transforms the standard Wing-Glasses from Kamina into the Star-Glasses in honor of Kitan.  If he can&#39;t have &quot;stars in his eyes&quot;, he&#39;ll do the next best thing and wear them on his face.<br>And, by the end of the series, when his role as a Hero and as a Leader is over and done, he gets a moment of pure happiness, being able to marry Nia before she completely fades away.  He <i>absolutely</i> has the Spiral Power to bring her back, but that&#39;s <i>precisely</i> the danger the Anti-spiral had warned him about; unfettered, self-serving, irresponsible abuse of Spiral Power would eventually lead to the destruction of <b>everything.</b>  Who was he to say his and Nia&#39;s personal happiness was more important than the happiness of everyone else in the whole universe; after all, he&#39;s no God, he&#39;s just a digger.<br>And so, he in turn has inspired the next generation, handed the story off to the &quot;story untold&quot;.  And there never needed to be a &quot;next generation&quot; series, the likes of &quot;Boruto&quot; any more than we needed a prequel series that showed the origins of the previous war against the Anti-Spiral.  Because there&#39;s neither beginning nor end; it&#39;s an infinite, twisting path from past, through present, on to the future.  Amd Gurren Lagann was just one little window, a slice of that infinity, meant to inspire <b>us,</b> the viewers, to go on to become our <i>own</i> Heroes and Leaders in our <i>own</i> stories.<br>Believe in the You that Simon the Digger Believes in.",0,0,2023-12-04T23:09:12Z

And the theme of breaking though your limitations in a hope for a better future.. Its a good series especially kamina.. He might be flawed like a repeating tape recorder.. But his confidence in his lil bro aka Simon in becoming someone better then him was his end goal.. I love his character just because he&#39;s relatable in this predicmant.. As a older bro i have the same mentality as him. Pushing my sibling to do better then me. Even if they are scared to take the leap.. Yeah I might be harsh but I care for there future more then being scene as a heartless brother. Either way this is a great show 10/10.

Kamina is manipulative but in a positive way(he‚Äôs actually a good person). The only thing I‚Äôll agree on is the whole top dog thing they both do. I dunno, maybe I‚Äôm overreacting cause gurren lagann is my favorite anime (I look at Kamina as more of a Zack Fair then a Tyler Durden). Great video tho",0,1,2021-12-10T04:35:13Z

Someone is just dead, but five minutes ago he wasn&#39;t. It&#39;s what happens next that actually defines the death: how you grieve. Anyone who had someone important for them like a relative or even a pet will agree, the heavy part is what you feel after the loss, not the moment itself. <br><br>This is something even some way more touching animes that revolve entirely around the emotions of death (Ano Hana, Your Lie In April) etc. Fail to communicate, in favor of just emphasize the sadness of a goodbye, which will be filled later.<br><br>When I first saw Nia, i was scared she was gonna be like &quot;Oh cool protagonist is dead, let&#39;s put a cute girl to fill the gap&quot; and holy shit was I happy to be wrong.<br><br>Even the ending, how even after saving the universe from space tyrants it wasn&#39;t enough to grant Simon a happy stereotypical life in the end, was so on point, it was just too good, and just like Kamina, Nia was gone in a flash, living behind only the memories she made with everyone. This is just telling you that Simon and Kamina are not special because they are the protagonists, but rather they were the protagonists because they are special. No plot armor, no stereotypical happy life, nothing that usually would make you say &quot;yeah this makes sense, he&#39;s the protagonist&quot;.",0,0,2021-11-04T16:28:38Z

The show is with a message, and there&#39;s a conversation, an ebb and flow between the thesis (&quot;spiral power&quot;=&quot;absolute boldness/relentless will to power&quot;=&quot;truly divine, the real hope of humanity and universe&quot;) and the antithesis (&quot;there must be some type of control/relent/compromise/stabilizing, one cannot march on with absolute will to power&quot;). Yet with the &quot;anything goes&quot; rule, the show already presupposed the divinity of the spiral power/will to power, therefore rendering this dialectic weightless. Case in point, Simon will always win the case against Rossiu/the anti-spiral, not because he demonstrated true qualities superior to Rossiu or even the anti-spiral, but because the show gave him a plot armor the size of the universe.",0,1,2021-08-02T19:31:08Z

Surely you must kid. <br><br>So if I see an injured child on the street I should just walk past since that child will eventually die at some point? <br><br>It is this kind of logical fallacies that I do dislike a lot. Him prolonging her life until a method could be created to save her is not sefishness or understanding balance. <br><br>This is just assisted suicide and nothing else. Nia was ready to die, and rather then keep fighting, Simon sat by and watched... Just because she was fine with going on these terms... terms that could be prevented quite easily. <br><br>So if a sick person  that is in lot of pain asks you to turn off the switch on the devices that are keeping them alive. Would you do it? Even if you knew that this person would recover to full health if they just undertook the surgery that was planned next day? This is that kind of situation.  <br><br>That is why it is uncharacteristic thing that a lot of people hate.

Ugz2ed8H1zMcU7Ppaht4AaABAg,@Elmithian,"The issue with Nia&#39;s death is manyfold. For one, she was a creation of the antispirals. Which means that when she disappears in the wedding, she is not dying, she stopped existing.<br><br>Now, there is very big difference between those two in Gurren  Lagann universe. If you die, you are not necessarily gone, an essence of you lives on, both overall and in the heart of people. <br><br>But Nia was built out of the antithesis of that idea. Her very essence was built to... simply break down after a while. Like a soulless tool.<br><br>Sure she may have a soul, but that soul was essentially built of the opposite essence of what humans were made out of. Meaning, even when Simon dies, their souls will never be reunited. <br><br>So yeah, I have a lot of issues regarding that part of the ending. Both morally and logically considering the in-universe logic of things.<br><br>It should have been just matter of fact to create some sort of antispiral device that would sustain Nia&#39;s existence until they found a way to polarise her from antispiral to spiral energy.<br><br> So going through all that length to save her, only to <b>kill</b> her due to lack if action in the end just feels utterly wrong and has nothing to do with accepting death as a part of life.<br><br> It was simply the creators fudging up at the end due to being unsure how to end the story dramatically enough and nothing more then that.",0,0,2017-08-25T17:25:12Z

I&#39;m not saying I have the perfect answers or anything for this but it&#39;s something that has always interested me. That splinter in her relationship with Simon is absolutely fascinating and tragic. Which makes it all the more ripe for analysis.

I have to know, how are you able to dissect and convey the inner meanings and themes of animes and articulate your points to such a high standard and with such maturity. Did you study in something, or have you just watched a lot of anime.¬†Right now, I am trying to write my own anime, and I believe that written characters are paramount to a good story, so being able to understand the aspects of what make other good animes I think would benefit me a lot when creating my own, however, I don&#39;t think I have the skill to do that yet. When I watched Gurren Laggan, I was one of those people who intentionally write it off as a dumb comedy for it&#39;s easier episodes and only found value in it for its second half. It&#39;s only through watching your videos that this anime was a lot better than I thought. I didn&#39;t like Kamina at first, but I cried when he died, and I couldn&#39;t for the life of me figure out what, but again, your analysis has allowed me to see the deeper layers that this anime has, and how they affected me as a viewer without me even realising.",0,3,2017-04-29T11:18:42Z
