"The last time a friend and I were at the cheesecake factory, in July, we weren't impressed. The menu is way too big, always has been! (Robert Irvine would cut that down to 1 or 2 pages!) All of the things we really liked to order are not on the menu anymore. And the cheesecake slices were smaller than before. We decided we will eat somewhere else and just go there to get a piece of cheesecake to go.",4

"Went to Cheesecake Factory at Christiana Mall last Sunday - ordered the Cuban sandwich. Was very dissatisfied.  Not a lot of meat on the sandwich,  and whomever prepared the sandwich must have shifted it or dropped it onto the plate as they were going to cut it in half. When it was brought to my table,  cut in half,  all of the meat was on one half - the other half had nothing on it. I took half of the meat from the one side and put it on thy empty side... very messy and very small portions on the sandwich in a whole.  Really bad for the price I paid.",1
And that would be good enough!,3
The menu now is way too massive. Needs to be smaller.,18
