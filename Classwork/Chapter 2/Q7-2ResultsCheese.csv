0,"Sue Y.San Mateo, CA","Ventured into The Cheesecake Factory, expecting primarily desserts, and decided to try their chicken sandwich. A pleasant surprise! The chicken was tender, seasoned well, and nestled between a perfectly toasted bun. The ambiance was welcoming and grand, making it a comfortable dining experience. But as delicious as the sandwich was, the cheesecake still stole the show. Creamy, decadent, and rich  a must-have!While the menu can be a tad overwhelming with its vast choices, it's worth navigating for the delightful dishes they serve.Will return, if not for another sandwich, then surely for the cheesecake.",4,0.3961111111111111,0.8103703703703703,0.0,0.693,0.307,0.9871
1,"Kiyomi W.Elite 2023Elk Grove, CA","Came in on a Sunday around 6 with a reservation but wasn't seated until shortly after 6Our waiter Jordan wasn't too attentive and took awhile getting more water, bread, and ordering. I ordered the chicken Marsala but Jordan said that it might not be available any more but he would let me know. I did give him a second option but he never told me the chicken Marsala was not available until my other order came out so I was taken by surprise. My second option was the shrimp scampi but it had dairy that I cannot have so I had to send it back. The other waiter that brought it out told me I could get another dish and he would put the order in. Then our waiter Jordan came back and asked what else I would like but I told him someone else already took it but Jordan said no that dish won't work so I had to order something else. The manager finally came and took my order but then Jordan came like 10 minutes later with a list of dairy free items but I told him i had already ordered. So there was a lot of miscommunication happening and I just really wanted to be able to eat lol. Everyone in my party got their food at the same time besides one dish that eventually came out but it looked very dry like it was sitting for too long. When we got the bill we noticed we were charged for an extra dish and Jordan said oh I thought my manager took care of that already. Honestly not pleased at all with the service and time it took to get the food so will not be back",2,0.06397435897435898,0.43769230769230766,0.025,0.872,0.103,0.9792

They have so many different food/ drink options to choose from. The service is always great when I come here and you can't forget about the complimentary bread they serve you! So delicious. The space is pretty big on the inside seats so many people and great for big parties. Also has an outdoor area. Definitely one of my go-to's.,5,0.39375,0.5812499999999999,0.0,0.63,0.37,0.9909
3,"Gina S.Elite 2023Elk Grove, CA","It's been at least 4 years since I've eaten here and I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised at how good it still is. I was so glad that I signed up for their rewards program so that I could make reservations online otherwise it would have been an hour and a half wait! We were seated within 10 minutes which was great! Drinks were good, especially that Mai Tai and Espresso Martini. I loved my French Dip Cheeseburger with Aus Jus, it was like a guilty pleasure along with the crisp French fries. Someone in my party had the Carbonara Pasta with chicken and I would definitely order it next time, it was really delicious. And the cheesecake?? Well, it is what they are known for right?! I tried the Basque Style cheesecake- It was the bomb and goes down so easy even when you're stuffed lol.

Upon arrival, was seated within a few minutes after. Place is clean and welcoming as always (5/5). Our server was nice and welcomed us. Tended to us just enough but not overwhelming. Waiter service is a solid 5/5. We placed our order and food was served within 15 minutes straight from the kitchen. Presentation of the food is excellent (5/5). And taste is super yummy (5/5). I highly recommend the fish tacos. My partner got the chicken tacos. Alls came out real nice. We didn't get drinks this time. But overall experience is a solid 5/5. Cost to dine here is slightly on the higher side compared to other places. Value/Price ratio is about a 4.75/5. I would highly recommend making reservations ahead of time.

5,"Eva W.Elite 2023Elk Grove, CA","Came here to get together with some friends.  We made reservations ahead of time.  We didn't wait long for our table.  The menu has a wide variety of items.  I ordered the miso salmon and I substituted with mash potatoes.  I did request for my salmon to be medium rare, but not too rare.  This way they don't overcook it and becomes dry.  I got medium when my entree came out.  Which was still good.  The salmon tasted fine, and the mash was ok.  The service was mediocre.  The server was nowhere to be found when we needed something.  When requested for something, it took her awhile to do the task.  We sat there waiting for her most of the time.",3,0.2,0.6300000000000001,0.0,0.936,0.064,0.7964

I made reservations but when we got there we had to wait a few minutes. It was weird because people without reservations seemed to be getting seated right away. It's a big place and it was still early at 530. We got seated in the back section. like a large side room. There were lots of people, the section was about full. I ordered the di Vinci pasta and it was pretty good. Oh and the clam chowder wasn't bad. My wife got the miso salmon which was good too. Everyone enjoyed their food. Chicken tenders and season salmon. The portions were pretty large.

7,"Amy H.Elite 2023Sacramento, CA","Came here a couple nights ago for a celebration, and I had an okay experience!We had a party of 12 people. We tried reserving ahead of time, but when we called, they stated that they don't do reservations, and if we come reserve at least 2 hours ahead, then there's a chance to be seated. When one of our groups went to reserve around 5:00pm, we checked in around 6:30pm to see where the wait is at and they said it's close but not so soon. About 10-15 minutes later they told us it'll be about an hour more wait because the party ahead of us arrived late. We were tired but we still decided to wait around. That's when they told us around 7:38pm that our table was ready. Some of us were in the middle of shopping and told us we might lose our spot. It was hectic trying to get there on time as we weren't given sufficient notice and we were informed that our wait time was pushed back. Kinda disappointing but it is what it is when there's a big crowd. When we arrived, we were seated and our server was very kind and provided us a pleasant service! What I got was the Crusted Chicken Romano and it was okay. The chicken tasted kind of bland, but the pasta was good and simple! It's really just crusted chicken with light tomato sauce on top of spaghetti noodles. At least the portions were huge! I could only eat half of this and be full. The place always has a dim light setting, but it has a nice ambiance and very spacious! Our table was clean and neat.",3,0.12735294117647059,0.5771708683473389,0.035,0.823,0.142,0.9868
8,"Amanda F.Moreno Valley, CA","Cheesecake Factory... why is your menu 100 pages?! It is so much to read and look through which made it hard for me to make a decision. The disclaimers at the bottom of the ""side dishes"" page are a little weird to me too. Prices subject to change WITHOUT notice? How are you going to tell me that my $40 steak now costs $50 when it doesn't say it on the menu or anywhere? I'm sure if the prices ever do change like that you will get a lot of complaints because people like to know what they're paying for something before they buy it. Also, what's up with the tip notice? When I read that I think it says that you add 18% to the bill for parties of 8 or more but you don't have to pay it if you don't want to? Why add the 18% then? I don't know, maybe it's just me or the wording seems a bit off. Also, ouch, prices are a bit high in my opinion... but then again they're high everywhere. With that said I ordered the lunch flatbread and salad combo and it was really good. I also got a mocktail which is great when you want something fancy but don't want to drink alcohol. My server, Nicole, was awesome. She gave me good suggestions of what to order when I asked her what her favorite thing on the menu was. She was friendly, attentive but not overly so, and she had my to go order to my table at the perfect time. Thanks Nicole!",4,0.33884259259259264,0.6441049382716049,0.023,0.817,0.16,0.9928

12,"Jennifer S.Elite 23Folsom, CA","This may be hard to believe, but I've been back to this Cheesecake Factory location twice since my last two-star review. Most recently, my friend (who also wrote her own review) and I stopped by Saturday night, after doing some shopping at Arden Fair Mall.I ordered the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka pasta, while my friend ordered a ribeye steak with brussel sprouts.We also ordered the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer, but when we found out that they were out, I convinced my friend to ""just eat our food, and then see how we feel."" We were half full on bread by this point, anyway.Our server was very attentive, and made sure our bread and drinks stayed full, in spite of the fact that the restaurant seemed to be understaffed. A floor manager seemed to be stepping in to help with server assistant duties. This was very fortunate for us, because the head hostess really seems to hate us, like, personally. She actually called us up to tell us our table was ready, only to tell us to wait again, four separate times before the manager came along and seated/saved us. Whew. We were starting to think we'd be playing musical chairs all night. Maybe this hostess has read my prior Yelp review, and recognized me? Every time we come in, we end up joking about how much she seems to hate us. While I haven't caught her name (and have a personal policy against posting waitstaff names/pictures/identifying information in my reviews), I'm almost willing to bet she's the same hostess described at length in Ana Z.s recent review on 2/15/23. Anyway, as I mentioned, I ordered the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka pasta. Two words that I would absolutely never use to describe the dish I was served are ""spicy"" and ""vodka."" It was literally the sauce base from the Four Cheese Pasta, which is what I usually order.The ""spice"" and ""vodka"" flavors were entirely absent. It was a mild, creamy, tomato basil sauce (it was the Four Cheese Pasta sauce).When I noticed that the pancetta was missing, I almost thought that they had just brought me the wrong dish by mistake. Yet, this wasn't the Four Cheese Pasta, either, because it was made with rigatoni (versus penne), was full of cherry tomatoes, and was not topped with a dollop of ricotta. I'm not saying the pasta I ordered was bad, but it definitely did not match the description of what I ordered, or of anything else on the menu. The serving size also seemed much smaller than usual. If this is The Cheesecake Factory's response to inflation, I'm not okay with it. The ribeye, which was ordered ""medium to medium rare, or maybe rare if you think the steak is really good"" came out medium well. We had to look hard to find any pink. The bite that I sampled was full of grisly fat, and was not good.To be fair, I had heavily advised my friend against ordering steak at The Cheesecake Factory, but she was determined. As she was boxing it up, I told her I'm going to take her to my favorite steak place (on Sutter Street in Folsom) to help her make reparations to her taste buds.For dessert, my friend wanted to ask the server to pick for us, which I advised against, as it was he who had picked the ribeye. We finally agreed to give him a short list to pick from, out of which he picked the red velvet cake.Neither of us had ever tried the red velvet cake before (my favorite cheesecake is the Very Cherry Ghirardelli), so we were excited to try it, but, we hated it. It was terrible. It was literally the worst red velvet cake I've ever had. There was hardly any cake in it at all, and the whole thing tasted like frosting. I LOVE sweetness overloads, but this was sickening. I would never order this dessert again.After my last review, obviously, I had to check the restrooms, to see if the soap situation had been resolved. This time, all of the dispensers were in working order, and they were all full. The bathroom wasn't spotless, but it was relatively clean, given that this was during the tail end of a spring weekend dinner rush.I almost forgot to mention our drinks, but, as I'm writing this, I realize that the way I feel about the drinks is the way I feel about the whole restaurant. It's okay, but not worth the hefty price tag. For the price point, I would expect better.She had three glasses of the house red blend, which tasted very heavily of merlot, with a little cabernet. I had a Georgia Peach, followed by a vodka cranberry. (We were there for a long time.)Overall, I still love The Cheesecake Factory, but this location consistently underwhelms. There is still a good chance I'll be back, but that's mostly because my friend loves this place so much.Edit in response to management's ""response"":In response to the comment that I should 'talk to the manager next time,' I feel like saying that you should read my whole review before posting a comment on it next time. But, based on the effort this location puts into their customer service, I think we both know that won't be happening. Lol.",2,0.0485392156862745,0.498124183006536,0.063,0.812,0.125,0.9966

The service was fast and the server is wonderful. The bread that was offered before the meal was fantastic. Wanted to eat more but we had to save room for other food we ordered. There are two different menus - the normal menu and the low calories menu. I was on diet, and it was perfect that there was this SkinnyLicious Chicken Pasta which was only 580 cal. It was tasty and satisfied my craving for pasta. We wanted clam chowder too but it was not available on Saturday, so got some other creamy soup instead which was good too. For cake we got the Original which was soft and creamy, and healthier lol (only 830 cal lol).Will come back for another date night:)",4,0.20288461538461539,0.6416666666666665,0.015,0.808,0.176,0.9801
16,"Cindy M.Elite 23Sacramento, CA","I came here with my family for an early birthday celebration. We were warmly greeted by the staff and we were also seated pretty quickly at around 5 pm. Our server was Lauren and she was super friendly and accommodating. Giving her a shoutout early on in this review, because she deserves it. We didn't tell her we were there for a birthday, but she went above and beyond, and noticed that my birthday was coming up and brought a lil ice cream sundae. So sweet of her!I had been to Cheesecake Factory in the past, years ago, but my family had never been here before. There were limitless options for food and all of us were overwhelmed (but in a good way) because there was something for everyone. The staff checked in with us often enough (not too much and not too infrequently). We ordered/ate:-bread: multigrain one I remembered being better...I actually enjoyed the sourdough better! It had a good flavor, but not too sour. I appreciated that the staff brought out two baskets of bread for 6 people to share.-avocado eggroll: comes with 6 pieces, so it was enough for each person to have one. I appreciated that the stand-in server for Lauren asked if we wanted another portion, just in case it was addicting. Low key was addicting, but I wanted to save room for the rest of the meal. Anyway, the eggrolls aren't like your typical Asian eggrolls. It's basically lots of chopped avocado and maybe some bell peppers inside of a wonton wrapper.- herb crusted salmon: more herb coating the salmon. Salmon was soft, tender. I like that the mashed potatoes are so chunky and creamy. There's also a few spears of asparagus that were good (not too fibrous!)-Sheila's chicken and avocado salad: this is a HUGE salad. This is definitely plenty to share. It has a great texture and flavor to it. There's lettuce, red cabbage, large carrot shreds, shredded chicken, cashews. I would totally order this salad again. Between the herb crusted salmon and this salad, it was plenty for two people to share and to be a balanced meal with protein, carbs, and veggies...if you care about that!-tiramisu cheesecake: really good cheesecake! I was expecting it to be super sweet, but it was almost perfect. It's exactly what you would expect when these two desserts come together. I think the coffee flavor balances the rest of the cheesecake. I would totally order this again.-bonus birthday sundae: it was a little cup of vanilla ice cream, with fudge at the bottom of the cup, and whipped cream with sprinkles. The plate was cute , too, in that there was whipped cream anchoring the cup to the plate, and they wrote in cursive with fudge, ""Happy birthday to you."" So cute and pretty!I had a great experience the entire time at Cheesecake Factory, and would absolutely come back to celebrate other occasions!",3,0.2226705586080586,0.5271520146520147,0.009,0.781,0.21,0.999

But our waiter was so nice even though I said I'd just eat it as Is and took my plate back and asked if I wanted a comp soup or fries while I waited.

I LOVED their jambalaya Shrimp Pasta but this time around it was just watery. No type of flavor. They were also out of the pasta noodle so I substituted it for the Alfredo noodle. The Alfredo noodle was thick sauce but was not salty enough for my taste. There was a good amount of meat. Which I loved! The burrito was by far the best one out of the dishes we ordered. The portion was huge! Three us of were able to eat out of it and get a taste of the flavorful burrito!,2,0.3979166666666667,0.6166666666666667,0.038,0.829,0.134,0.9615
38,"Susan L.Citrus Heights, CA","Myself, my business associate and her daughter decided to have a celebratory dinner at cheesecake factory on March 31.It was packed. We were given waters. I ordered coffee. The young man never came back to ask if I wanted any more. We ordered an appetizer. Took 30 minutes to get it.I ordered salmon.My business associate ordered the chicken and shrimp with rice.The daughter is ordered salad with chicken.Then we waited 45 minutes.My coffee got cold. I asked the young man to give me a fresh cup of coffee. He brought the same cup back had only partially filled it with coffee. Still cold.I noticed that the cup had a large chip out of the glass.Called him back. I said why did you bring me a broken glass. He said you asked me for a coffee. Why didn't you notice the glass? Like it was my fault.Finally dinner arrived.My business associates dinner had three pieces of tiny old hard shrimp.The daughter was given a salad without any chicken in it at all even though it said specifically it included chicken not as an add-on.My food was actually fine except of the subpar mashed potatoes slightly cold .This is when it got awful.The manager came by wanted to know how she could help. We told her of the problems. She promised to get us chicken for the salad, wanted to know how many more shrimp my business associate wanted. I guess she didn't hear the part about it being Cold and old.She asked the daughter to dig through the plate to see if the chicken was on the bottom of the salad, as she claimed ""it usually was."" There was none.I told her about my coffee cup.The three of us had a conversation at the dinner table. We decided that we no longer wanted to eat here because the service had been absolutely horrible and digging through ones salad instead of eating ones salad was not exactly how we wanted to spend our celebration dinner ...looking for chicken.I got up to find the manager. Walked her back to the table. Told her we wanted to leave. She presented us with a partial bill ...first it was $66. We never got the chicken dinner even though we asked for it to be wrapped.I told her to take the chicken off of it.Now down to $41.And then I also wanted not to be charged appetizer for all the bullshit that had been served us.She insisted that we pay for the partially filled Cosmo not worth 16 bucks.At that point we were getting a little upset.The manager looked at me and said ""I can see you are getting upset. I suggest that we bring this anger down to a more manageable level.""I assured her that we were perfectly capable of managing our own anger levels thank you very much.We walked out. Manageable? She wouldn't know the meaning of the word.",1,-0.11782557720057722,0.5346139971139969,0.062,0.889,0.049,-0.7807
39,"Tristan B.Roseville, CA","I would call the restaurant trendy, but it has an upscale appearance. The inside is decorated pleasantly! They offer a full bar which we took a vantage of. Their food is really consistent. It's tasty and there's plenty of it to be had. We have leftovers for both dinner and dessert! The steak was cooked, rare to perfection And the chicken was lightly breaded and not overcooked. The bowtie pasta was just barely al dente which is how I prefer it! The sauce was tasty. Some people may find it watery, but I think that's how it's traditionally done... I had a pineapple Moscow Mule, which was to die for! And there's great beer on tap. We sat at the bar because the place was pretty busy around 7 o'clock on a Friday but our food got to us fast wants me to figure it out what we wanted. Truth be told that was an awesome spot to sit because we could watch the football game and watching the bartender on duty was like a show in itself!

It was like somebody chopped up a potato and kept stirring it up so it turned it into fucking glue and the chicken the greasy crust bits that were left on top because they're actually was no crust it either burnt onto the pan or who the fuck knows what happened to it all I can tell you is this will be the last meal I get at cheesecake factory I paid $80 for one entrée three meatballs as an appetizer a half a glass of wine and a drink that is way above standard for this bullshit you just put out and if I could have a chance at not leaving any fucking stars you get three thumbs down and no fucking stars and whoever's working in the Fucking kitchen on Mondays deserves to be fired because that asshole doesn't give one shit about what he's fucking putting out into the restaurant.

Seriously how hard is it to bring out food when it's hot?! If something is delaying the meals, then someone should be mature enough to explain the reason for the 30 minute delay. It turned out to be the country potatoes!We should have been given the option to choose something other than the potatoes. Now neither of us are enjoying our meal.  I am definitely not going to pay for these terrible meals meant to be eaten inside the restaurant. When the server finally checked on us, she said I should have flagged her down sooner. It's my responsibility to get back into my wheelchair and go find her. Excuse me?! The manager came over and apologized and comped our uneaten meals. The server proved to show some mature maturity by telling her manager all that happened, including how she told me ""I should have told her"". The manager also apologized for said comment and agreed it is not the customer's responsibility to check on the server.
