A pleasant surprise! The chicken was tender, seasoned well, and nestled between a perfectly toasted bun. 

The ambiance was welcoming and grand, making it a comfortable dining experience. But as delicious as the sandwich was, the cheesecake still stole the show. Creamy, decadent, and rich  a must-have!

While the menu can be a tad overwhelming with its vast choices, it's worth navigating for the delightful dishes they serve.

Will return, if not for another sandwich, then surely for the cheesecake.","2023-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","ATwQeUhobAg34f7jRdtX9g","1","0","1","en","2","Elk Grove, CA","Kiyomi W.","108","https://www.yelp.com//user_details?userid=xQWMXvuWS7HP9P63x2p1Nw","Came in on a Sunday around 6 with a reservation but wasn't seated until shortly after 6

Our waiter Jordan wasn't too attentive and took awhile getting more water, bread, and ordering. 
I ordered the chicken Marsala but Jordan said that it might not be available any more but he would let me know. I did give him a second option but he never told me the chicken Marsala was not available until my other order came out so I was taken by surprise. My second option was the shrimp scampi but it had dairy that I cannot have so I had to send it back. The other waiter that brought it out told me I could get another dish and he would put the order in. Then our waiter Jordan came back and asked what else I would like but I told him someone else already took it but Jordan said no that dish won't work so I had to order something else. The manager finally came and took my order but then Jordan came like 10 minutes later with a list of dairy free items but I told him i had already ordered. So there was a lot of miscommunication happening and I just really wanted to be able to eat lol. 

Everyone in my party got their food at the same time besides one dish that eventually came out but it looked very dry like it was sitting for too long. 

When we got the bill we noticed we were charged for an extra dish and Jordan said oh I thought my manager took care of that already. 
Honestly not pleased at all with the service and time it took to get the food so will not be back","2023-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","0Uqzy1P36Wh0FOQPLCleSg","0","0","0","en","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WfY41MbEwS7ZuBDMVShldA/o.jpg","5","Sacramento, CA","Marisol E.","21","https://www.yelp.com//user_details?userid=9pxP2baku7aq5He4MzXYeA","Cheesecake factory never disappoints!

I was so glad that I signed up for their rewards program so that I could make reservations online otherwise it would have been an hour and a half wait! We were seated within 10 minutes which was great! 
Drinks were good, especially that Mai Tai and Espresso Martini. I loved my French Dip Cheeseburger with Aus Jus, it was like a guilty pleasure along with the crisp French fries. Someone in my party had the Carbonara Pasta with chicken and I would definitely order it next time, it was really delicious. And the cheesecake?? Well, it is what they are known for right?!

Been here before but never wrote up a review before. We came here for dinner. Had reservations at 6pm. 

Upon arrival, was seated within a few minutes after. Place is clean and welcoming as always (5/5). Our server was nice and welcomed us. Tended to us just enough but not overwhelming. Waiter service is a solid 5/5. 

We placed our order and food was served within 15 minutes straight from the kitchen. Presentation of the food is excellent (5/5). And taste is super yummy (5/5). 

I highly recommend the fish tacos. My partner got the chicken tacos. 

Alls came out real nice. We didn't get drinks this time. But overall experience is a solid 5/5. 

Cost to dine here is slightly on the higher side compared to other places. Value/Price ratio is about a 4.75/5.

We had a party of 12 people. We tried reserving ahead of time, but when we called, they stated that they don't do reservations, and if we come reserve at least 2 hours ahead, then there's a chance to be seated. When one of our groups went to reserve around 5:00pm, we checked in around 6:30pm to see where the wait is at and they said it's close but not so soon. About 10-15 minutes later they told us it'll be about an hour more wait because the party ahead of us arrived late. We were tired but we still decided to wait around. That's when they told us around 7:38pm that our table was ready. Some of us were in the middle of shopping and told us we might lose our spot. It was hectic trying to get there on time as we weren't given sufficient notice and we were informed that our wait time was pushed back. Kinda disappointing but it is what it is when there's a big crowd. 

When we arrived, we were seated and our server was very kind and provided us a pleasant service! 

What I got was the Crusted Chicken Romano and it was okay. The chicken tasted kind of bland, but the pasta was good and simple! It's really just crusted chicken with light tomato sauce on top of spaghetti noodles. At least the portions were huge! I could only eat half of this and be full. 

The place always has a dim light setting, but it has a nice ambiance and very spacious!

It is so much to read and look through which made it hard for me to make a decision. The disclaimers at the bottom of the ""side dishes"" page are a little weird to me too. Prices subject to change WITHOUT notice? How are you going to tell me that my $40 steak now costs $50 when it doesn't say it on the menu or anywhere? I'm sure if the prices ever do change like that you will get a lot of complaints because people like to know what they're paying for something before they buy it. Also, what's up with the tip notice? When I read that I think it says that you add 18% to the bill for parties of 8 or more but you don't have to pay it if you don't want to? Why add the 18% then? I don't know, maybe it's just me or the wording seems a bit off. Also, ouch, prices are a bit high in my opinion... but then again they're high everywhere. 

With that said I ordered the lunch flatbread and salad combo and it was really good. I also got a mocktail which is great when you want something fancy but don't want to drink alcohol.

Most recently, my friend (who also wrote her own review) and I stopped by Saturday night, after doing some shopping at Arden Fair Mall.

I ordered the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka pasta, while my friend ordered a ribeye steak with brussel sprouts.

We also ordered the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer, but when we found out that they were out, I convinced my friend to ""just eat our food, and then see how we feel."" We were half full on bread by this point, anyway.

Our server was very attentive, and made sure our bread and drinks stayed full, in spite of the fact that the restaurant seemed to be understaffed. A floor manager seemed to be stepping in to help with server assistant duties. 

This was very fortunate for us, because the head hostess really seems to hate us, like, personally. She actually called us up to tell us our table was ready, only to tell us to wait again, four separate times before the manager came along and seated/saved us. 

Whew. We were starting to think we'd be playing musical chairs all night. Maybe this hostess has read my prior Yelp review, and recognized me? Every time we come in, we end up joking about how much she seems to hate us. 

While I haven't caught her name (and have a personal policy against posting waitstaff names/pictures/identifying information in my reviews), I'm almost willing to bet she's the same hostess described at length in Ana Z.s recent review on 2/15/23. 

Anyway, as I mentioned, I ordered the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka pasta. Two words that I would absolutely never use to describe the dish I was served are ""spicy"" and ""vodka."" It was literally the sauce base from the Four Cheese Pasta, which is what I usually order.

The ""spice"" and ""vodka"" flavors were entirely absent. It was a mild, creamy, tomato basil sauce (it was the Four Cheese Pasta sauce).

When I noticed that the pancetta was missing, I almost thought that they had just brought me the wrong dish by mistake. Yet, this wasn't the Four Cheese Pasta, either, because it was made with rigatoni (versus penne), was full of cherry tomatoes, and was not topped with a dollop of ricotta. 

I'm not saying the pasta I ordered was bad, but it definitely did not match the description of what I ordered, or of anything else on the menu. The serving size also seemed much smaller than usual. If this is The Cheesecake Factory's response to inflation, I'm not okay with it. 

The ribeye, which was ordered ""medium to medium rare, or maybe rare if you think the steak is really good"" came out medium well. We had to look hard to find any pink. The bite that I sampled was full of grisly fat, and was not good.

To be fair, I had heavily advised my friend against ordering steak at The Cheesecake Factory, but she was determined. As she was boxing it up, I told her I'm going to take her to my favorite steak place (on Sutter Street in Folsom) to help her make reparations to her taste buds.

For dessert, my friend wanted to ask the server to pick for us, which I advised against, as it was he who had picked the ribeye. We finally agreed to give him a short list to pick from, out of which he picked the red velvet cake.

Neither of us had ever tried the red velvet cake before (my favorite cheesecake is the Very Cherry Ghirardelli), so we were excited to try it, but, we hated it. It was terrible. It was literally the worst red velvet cake I've ever had. 

There was hardly any cake in it at all, and the whole thing tasted like frosting. I LOVE sweetness overloads, but this was sickening. I would never order this dessert again.

After my last review, obviously, I had to check the restrooms, to see if the soap situation had been resolved. This time, all of the dispensers were in working order, and they were all full. The bathroom wasn't spotless, but it was relatively clean, given that this was during the tail end of a spring weekend dinner rush.

I almost forgot to mention our drinks, but, as I'm writing this, I realize that the way I feel about the drinks is the way I feel about the whole restaurant. It's okay, but not worth the hefty price tag. For the price point, I would expect better.

She had three glasses of the house red blend, which tasted very heavily of merlot, with a little cabernet. I had a Georgia Peach, followed by a vodka cranberry. (We were there for a long time.)

Overall, I still love The Cheesecake Factory, but this location consistently underwhelms. There is still a good chance I'll be back, but that's mostly because my friend loves this place so much.

Edit in response to management's ""response"":

In response to the comment that I should 'talk to the manager next time,' I feel like saying that you should read my whole review before posting a comment on it next time. But, based on the effort this location puts into their customer service, I think we both know that won't be happening.

We were warmly greeted by the staff and we were also seated pretty quickly at around 5 pm. Our server was Lauren and she was super friendly and accommodating. Giving her a shoutout early on in this review, because she deserves it. We didn't tell her we were there for a birthday, but she went above and beyond, and noticed that my birthday was coming up and brought a lil ice cream sundae. So sweet of her!

I had been to Cheesecake Factory in the past, years ago, but my family had never been here before. There were limitless options for food and all of us were overwhelmed (but in a good way) because there was something for everyone. The staff checked in with us often enough (not too much and not too infrequently). 

We ordered/ate:
-bread: multigrain one I remembered being better...I actually enjoyed the sourdough better! It had a good flavor, but not too sour. I appreciated that the staff brought out two baskets of bread for 6 people to share.

-avocado eggroll: comes with 6 pieces, so it was enough for each person to have one. I appreciated that the stand-in server for Lauren asked if we wanted another portion, just in case it was addicting. Low key was addicting, but I wanted to save room for the rest of the meal. Anyway, the eggrolls aren't like your typical Asian eggrolls. It's basically lots of chopped avocado and maybe some bell peppers inside of a wonton wrapper.

- herb crusted salmon: more herb coating the salmon. Salmon was soft, tender. I like that the mashed potatoes are so chunky and creamy. There's also a few spears of asparagus that were good (not too fibrous!)

-Sheila's chicken and avocado salad: this is a HUGE salad. This is definitely plenty to share. It has a great texture and flavor to it. There's lettuce, red cabbage, large carrot shreds, shredded chicken, cashews. I would totally order this salad again. Between the herb crusted salmon and this salad, it was plenty for two people to share and to be a balanced meal with protein, carbs, and veggies...if you care about that!

-tiramisu cheesecake: really good cheesecake! I was expecting it to be super sweet, but it was almost perfect. It's exactly what you would expect when these two desserts come together. I think the coffee flavor balances the rest of the cheesecake. I would totally order this again.

-bonus birthday sundae: it was a little cup of vanilla ice cream, with fudge at the bottom of the cup, and whipped cream with sprinkles. The plate was cute , too, in that there was whipped cream anchoring the cup to the plate, and they wrote in cursive with fudge, ""Happy birthday to you."" So cute and pretty!

I've been to this location a couple times in the past and they live up to the Cheesecake Factory expectations. The menu has something for everyone and the portions are generous.

The cheesecake is what sets it apart, as a teen in Ohio this was our go to hangout spot. We'd meet friends and share a few menu items and all split some cheesecake. It was a bonus that it was open later than a lot of the restaurants the local restaurants. That's where the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake became one of my favorite indulgent treats. It's so rich that it's easy to share and feels super fancy. 

That's what my husband brought home tonight along with a slice of the Chocolate mousse cheesecake. The first bite brought me back and I'll be enjoying baby spoon bites (yes I have a special tiny dessert spoon for ice cream and things like this) for the next couple days. 

During peak hours it can get very busy, so if you're wanting a table you may wait a bit. Definitely make a reservation if you can. 

You can get food and slices as well as whole cakes to go and they do offer limited customizations for birthdays or celebrations.","2023-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","dLukROEkceG_01V1e3mEhA","0","0","0","en","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ofrZLHr2qZwrumQkn6JHwQ/o.jpg","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MldveSEeeVVEfD0xnjEb2Q/o.jpg","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-VJlKCyAO_hduDw_EkuFFA/o.jpg","4","Sacramento, CA","Elizabeth W.","83","https://www.yelp.com//user_details?userid=FQ7oZOgf852YvygqWCHj0A","Came here for my hubby's birthday Celebration our waitress was very attentive and helpful with our menu our kids order few on the recommended in the menu .

It was packed. We were given waters. I ordered coffee. The young man never came back to ask if I wanted any more. We ordered an appetizer. Took 30 minutes to get it.

I ordered salmon.

My business associate ordered the chicken and shrimp with rice.

The daughter is ordered salad with chicken.

Then we waited 45 minutes.

My coffee got cold. I asked the young man to give me a fresh cup of coffee. He brought the same cup back had only partially filled it with coffee. Still cold.

I noticed that the cup had a large chip out of the glass.

Called him back. I said why did you bring me a broken glass. He said you asked me for a coffee. Why didn't you notice the glass? Like it was my fault.

Finally dinner arrived.

My business associates dinner had three pieces of tiny old hard shrimp.

The daughter was given a salad without any chicken in it at all even though it said specifically it included chicken not as an add-on.

My food was actually fine except of the subpar mashed potatoes slightly cold .

This is when it got awful.
The manager came by wanted to know how she could help. We told her of the problems. She promised to get us chicken for the salad, wanted to know how many more shrimp my business associate wanted. I guess she didn't hear the part about it being Cold and old.
She asked the daughter to dig through the plate to see if the chicken was on the bottom of the salad, as she claimed ""it usually was."" There was none.
I told her about my coffee cup.
The three of us had a conversation at the dinner table. We decided that we no longer wanted to eat here because the service had been absolutely horrible and digging through ones salad instead of eating ones salad was not exactly how we wanted to spend our celebration dinner ...looking for chicken.

I got up to find the manager. Walked her back to the table. Told her we wanted to leave. She presented us with a partial bill ...first it was $66. 
We never got the chicken dinner even though we asked for it to be wrapped.
I told her to take the chicken off of it.
Now down to $41.

And then I also wanted not to be charged appetizer for all the bullshit that had been served us.

She insisted that we pay for the partially filled Cosmo not worth 16 bucks.
At that point we were getting a little upset.

The manager looked at me and said ""I can see you are getting upset. I suggest that we bring this anger down to a more manageable level.""
I assured her that we were perfectly capable of managing our own anger levels thank you very much.

We walked out. Manageable? She wouldn't know the meaning of the word.","2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","xppxgjJ-aAjSW8rE7hgPOQ","0","0","0","en","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tEqRhCTAJRJ-Wv_LZuKbvg/o.jpg","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FrNttF4am02MWGvEGyM2nQ/o.jpg","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xXHdpouaS68437BzIc2JPQ/o.jpg","https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DToSoAdZDydmvvLioUMaKQ/o.jpg","4","Roseville, CA","Tristan B.","48","https://www.yelp.com//user_details?userid=oyQJ8cwdvKouUIlmHlwJnw","I would call the restaurant trendy, but it has an upscale appearance.

Ordered the fettuccine pasta and asian salad and I can say that even the lunch portions were very generous in servings. The free bread basket was a definite welcome treat. We ended up sharing an oreo cheesecake, which is one of their classic dessert treats.","2023-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","nZuJJgzrzYSqaTfKIXeHag","0","0","0","en","5","Las Vegas, NV","Fluffi B.","7","https://www.yelp.com//user_details?userid=L1aPa6k9wy04AOVg0DYtVA","I just wanted to say that I had the best experience today. Savannah at the front has the most brilliant smile and treated everyone so kindly. She was especially warm and friendly to an older gentleman (he looked like he was in his 70s or 80s) and it was so nice. The food and service here with Erica C was outstanding! She is my favorite server here and I look forward to seeing her again :) Thank you everyone for the lovely experience today~","2023-10-04T20:04:02.106Z","","Food","https://locations.thecheesecakefactory.com/ca/sacramento-78.html"
